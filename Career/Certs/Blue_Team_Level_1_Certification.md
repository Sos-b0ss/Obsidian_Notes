The course is instructed by Joshua Beaman and aims to strengthen students’ defensive cybersecurity capabilities.

**NOTES:**
I cannot recommend this course/exam more. I wish they had not removed the reporting requirement, but the skills learned in this (entry-level) will set you on the right track. However, BTL2 should not be in your track afterward (check out CCD instead).  
  
Cons-wise, the course is obviously written by several individuals. Why does it matter? Well, the level of English varies. This may have been fixed since I took it back in 2022.
