**NOTES:**

If you work in Sales or HR,Â **this is the cert for you.**

Go directly to System Architect Associate.

It will teach the names of services and what they do. You'll learn what the engineers are talking about when talking about S3 buckets and why an ACL needs to be set up correctly. This is not intended to make you an expert on any one system nor is it meant to provide functional knowledge. You're getting a sales pitch into the AWS world sufficient that you can talk to customers about what services your company will be providing. For example, you'll learn what a server is and how AWS implements servers. You'll then learn what serverless means and how AWS implements that.  
  
Coming from a highly technical background, this certification took me about 2 days total. Skim the material and learn the AWS terms for standard features (elastic IP is a public IP, gotcha).  
  
If you're not coming from a technical background, you'll spend some time learning what ports are, what IP addresses are, and so on.  
  
This does, at the time of writing, give a coupon for your next AWS so maybe it pays for itself.
