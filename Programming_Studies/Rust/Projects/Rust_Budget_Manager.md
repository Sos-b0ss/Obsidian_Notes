Make a budget manager that has these basic functions:
- Add, remove, edit a budget
- Add, remove, edit transactions associated with a budget
- Display how much money is remaining in a budget
- Handle more than one budget

Good crates to help get started:
- console (Interface with terminal)
- dialoguer (Terminal user prompting)
- tui (Interactive terminal UI)
- rusqlite (Connect to SQLite databases)

Possible future add-ons to make it more useful:
- Provide a web API to make changes to the budget
- Display a warning when the user is getting close to going over budget
- Allow budget to be active for a specified time frame
