_Procedural Macros_ are a more feature-complete approach to creating 'macros' than a declarative macro can provide. They appear in many places in the Rust language and allow us to generate a lot of code with very little input.

## Kinds of Procedural Macros
There are three distinct kinds of procedural macros in Rust.
- Function-like macros: `function_like!()`
- Attribute macros: `#[attribute]`
- Custom derive macros: `#[derive()]`

Let's take a quick look at the differences between these.
\
**Function-like:**
\
Function-like procedural macros appear in our source code the same as declarative macros, written as a function call with a `!` postfix.
	ex:

	macro_for_fun!()

When calling these macros, there is little difference from calling declarative ones. However, behind the scenes, a procedural macro has much more flexibility in terms of parsing our input and what it can accomplish syntactically.
\
**Attribute:**
\
Attribute macros operate on the syntax of the item it is applied to. Here we are applying the procedural attribute macro `#[dance]` to the 'Human' struct.
	ex:

	#[dance]
	struct Human {
		legs: u8,
		arms: u8,
	}

Attributes macros can operate on more than just structs. In fact, they can be written to operate on almost anything.
	ex:

	#![deny(warnings)]

	#[allow(unused_variables)]
	let variable = "unused";

	#[get("/<name>")]
	fn response(name: &str) -> String {
		name.to_string()
	}

In order to know what an attribute does, it is always best to read the documentation.
\
**Derive Macros:**
\
We have encountered the `#[derive(Trait)]` macro many times throughout this course. Derive macros will automatically generate trait implementations for the type it is applied to.
	ex:

	// We probably want to do this on every type we make.
	#[derive(Debug)]
	struct Coordinate {
		x: i32,
		y: i32
	}

The reason why Derive is used so often is that it's so incredibly useful for generative a lot of code with just a few tokens.
\
**Creating Our Own:**
\
Procedural macros currently are required to be in their own crate, and utilize a very different approach to parsing input than declarative macros.
\
While creating procedural macros is out of the scope of this course, The Rust Book has a good example of 'How to write a custom `derive` Macro'. (See. https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html#how-to-write-a-custom-derive-macro)
