Here is a comprehensive list of the 5 most useful rust Traits that should be implemented into your types (methods). *note these are not part of the std library.

1. Debug - 
2. Clone - 
3. Default - 
4. PartialEq (Also check out PartialOrd, Hash, Eq, and Ord)- 
5. Send - This marks that your type is safe to send between threads.
6. Sync - This marks that your type is safe to shared between threads via references.

These are also some Traits that I should study and get familiar with (These are picked up from the Klondike Card game that was written in Rust):

- Copy - 
- Hash - 
- Ord - 
- PartialOrd - 
- IntoPrimitive - 
- TryFromPrimitive - 
- Display -
