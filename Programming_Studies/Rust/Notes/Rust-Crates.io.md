Thanks to Cargo, we are not limited to the std library. When we import crate, such as 'serde' in our manifest file, these libraries are pulled from a registry of source code located at 'crates.io'. (See. https://www.codecademy.com/courses/rust-for-programmers/articles/cargo-manifest)
\
**Finding Crates:**
\
When we are looking for a crate with particular functionality, we can search through all available crates directly at the 'crates.io' website. Crates are indexed by name, keywords, and descriptions as declared in the manifest.
\
To test this out, let's pretend that we thought of a great idea for a command line applactions. We can start out by searching the term "cli" which will then supply us with a multitude of libraries such as 'clap' that we can use to help us build our command-line applications.
\
Each crate has its own page with download statistics, links to the active repository, and links to the documentation. Cargo also has its own subcommand 'search' which allows us to search through the registry with the command line, 'cargo search serde'.
\
**Publishing a Crate:**
\
When we have created a binary or library that we wish to share with others, we can choose to publish our own crate to 'crates.io'.
\
There are a few things to keep in mind when publishing a crate.
- Remove all sensitive information from within your source code before publishing.
- It is recommended to follow 'semantic versioning'.
- The `-` and `_` characters are interchangeable within crate names.
- You cannot publish a crate that has dependencies linked to a git repository.
- Providing useful descriptions and documentation will help people find and utilize your crate.

Once you have written a crate that you feel confident in sharing, make sure the name of your crate is available, and then run the `cargo publish` command to publish your crate to the ages.
\
**Security Implications:**
\
Even though Rust as a language provides a great deal of inherent safety, eternal libraries are not inherently safe. Any piece of source code can be malicious, so to keep your code safe, it is wise to keep dependencies to a minimum and trust the crates you use.
\
If you are choosing to import a new crate that is not yet popular, take a quick look at the dependencies and source code of the crate. This is a great way to make sure your code is safe and also a great way to learn!
\
There are also tools such as 'cargo crev' which are attempts to build a web of trust regarding crate usage.
