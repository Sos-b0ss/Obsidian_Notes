Everything in Rust has a type.
\
Some types are so commonly used in programming that they have been baked directly into the language itself. These basic types are called primitives and they do not rely upon the std library.
\
**Boolean:**
\
The 'bool' primitive is a boolean value, which can be either 'false' or 'true'.
	ex:

	let this_is_a_variable = true;

	// A bool is its own conditional.
	if this_is_a_variable {
		println!("yep, its a variable");
	} else {
		println!("wrong universe");
	}

**Integers:**
\
Rust has multiple signed and unsigned integer primitives. They are designated by their memory size in bits and whether or not they allow negative numbers.
\
Integer types that begin with an 'i' are signed and allow negative integers, while unsigned integers begin with a 'u'.
\
For example, a 'u8' is an integer that can represent any number from 0 to 255.
\
Available integer primitives include:
- Signed integers: i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, isize
- Unsigned integers: u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, usize
'usize' and 'isize' will determine the memory size based on the system architecture during compilation. When no type is specified, Rust infers the type to be i32.
	ex:

	let integer = 102;
	let negative = -48;

	// We can type annotate our integers to make sure we can handle large numbers.
	let byte: u8 = 255;
	let large: i64 = -9223372036854775808;

	// We can also specify types as a postfix to the number.
	let byte = 255u8;
	let large = -9223372036854775808i64;

**Floating Points:**
\
Rust has two floating point types of differing precision, 'f32' and 'f64', which are also denoted by their bit size in memory. When no type type is specified, Rust infers 'f64'.
\
Floating point numbers are specified by their inclusion of a decimal point.
	ex:

	let float = 1.2;

	// Floats do not require a decimal portion.
	let still_a_float = 1.;

	// With type annotation.
	let a_less_precise_float: f32 = 2.83;

**Chars:**
\
A 'char' is a character, or more specifically a 'unicode scalar value'. (See. https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#unicode_scalar_value)
\
Chars are specified by enclosing the character within single parenthesis.
	ex:

	let letter = 'q';
	let accented = 'Ã¡';
	let percent = '%';
	let checkmark = 'âœ“';

Since Rust utilizes UTF-8 as an encoding scheme, some single width characters may be composed of multiple 'char's.
	ex:

	//This emoji is more than 1 char in length and cannot be declared as a char literal.
	// We must instead use a &str.
	let yourself = "ðŸ˜€";

**Other Primitives:**
\
The types we have just discussed are not the only primitives in Rust.
\
There are also 'arrays', 'str', and 'tuples'. The unit type is a special kind of tuple without any contained data. (See. https://www.codecademy.com/courses/rust-for-programmers/articles/arrays-and-vec, https://www.codecademy.com/courses/rust-for-programmers/articles/str-and-string, & https://www.codecademy.com/courses/rust-for-programmers/articles/tuples-rust)
\
Most importantly, function pointers are also a primitive type. This means we can pass functions the same with would any other type.
