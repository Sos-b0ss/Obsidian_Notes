The latest releases are likely to contain security fixes. A large amount of vulnerabilites dont end up actually getting reported so even if you may have the ability to work through the ones that have been reported its not the full picture.
\
With [[NPM]] you can check for updates with:
\
npm i -g npm-check-updates
ncu
\
Run this in the same directory as your package.json and it will print out all the dependancies that could be updated.
\
You still need to be careful however because it doesnt know which dependancies updates are compatible with eachother. However if you run instead:
ncu -u 
itll run npm install for all the dependancies.
\
For [[Java]] you can use the tool [[Maven]] and run the command:
mvn versions:display-dependancy-updates

For [[Gradle]] youll need to use two plugins:

	id("com.github.ben-manes.versions") version "0.28.0"
...
}
./gradlew useLatestVersions
