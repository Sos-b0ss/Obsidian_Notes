Switches are very power tools when needing to make an if statement that involves several different conditions such as if an RNG machine produces 4 different numbers and you want something different to happen for each number result:  
ex: let randomNumber = Math.floor(5 * Math.random());  
switch(randomNumber) {  
case 0:  
variable = '0';  
break;  
case 1:  
variable = '1';  
break;  
ect. ...  
};
