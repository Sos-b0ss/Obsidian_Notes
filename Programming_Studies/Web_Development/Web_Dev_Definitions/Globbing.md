Globbing is the process of expanding a non-specific file name containing a wildcard character into a set of specific file names that exist in storage on a computer, server, or network. A wildcard is a symbol that can stand for one or more character s.

In computer programming, glob patterns specify sets of filenames with wildcard characters. For example, the [[Unix]] [[Bash]] [[Shell]] command mv.txt textfiles/moves all files with names ending in.txt from the current directory to the directory textfiles.
