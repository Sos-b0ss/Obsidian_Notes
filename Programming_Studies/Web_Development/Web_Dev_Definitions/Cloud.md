Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand [[Network]] access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., [[Network]]s, [[Server]]s, storage, applications, and [[Services]]) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.
\
Cloud computing defined In simple terms, cloud computing allows you to rent instead of buy your [[IT]]. Rather than investing heavily in [[Database]]s, software, and hardware, companies opt to access their compute power via the [[Internet]], or the cloud, and pay for it as they use it.
\
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of [[IT]] resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and [[Database]]s, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services ([[AWS]]).
