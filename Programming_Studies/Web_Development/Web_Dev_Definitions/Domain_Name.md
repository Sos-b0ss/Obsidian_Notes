\
A [[Domain_Name]] is a unique [[String]] of text that's used to identify a specific resource on the [[Internet]]. This could be anything from a website to an email or [[FTP]] server.
\
When you access a website, its domain name is converted to a set of numbers (an [[IP_Address]]) to communicate with the website [[Server]] to send [[HTTP_Request]]s for and receive website content.
