[[DNS]] is the main index of the [[Internet]] that directs traffic for queries across the web. The simplest analogy is that of a contact list on your phone: contacts are sorted by name, but then they contain specific phone numbers or addresses. At its simplest, [[DNS]] is like that for the [[Internet]]. All [[Internet]] servers work on [[Internet_Protocol_Suite]] addresses ([[IP_Address]]es), which mostly look like several sets of numbers separated by periods (e.g. 123.456.789.100) though other variations exist.

The [[Domain_Name_System]] was not always the default for accessing information of the web. In the early days of internet usage, a small group of individual networks managed their own naming conventions. It wasnâ€™t until 1983 that the concept of a centralized [[DNS]] was created. When the Internet Engineering Task Force was created in 1986 to apply standard and best practices to the burgeoning platform, DNS was among its initial group of adopted guidelines.

However, the [[World_Wide_Web]] is designed for a simple user experience with domain names we can remember, such as www.google.com. [[DNS]] is the system that links domain names with their proper [[IP_address]]es. When web users enter a domain name in their [[Browser]], the local [[Internet_Service_Provider]] ([[ISP]]) uses [[DNS]] to identify the correct IP for the domain name, thus allowing the web user to download the desired page or asset. Further specific steps occur behind the scenes, but for the typical user, that is their experience.
