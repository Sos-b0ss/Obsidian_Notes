[[ICANN]], or the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, is a nonprofit organization designed as the postal system of the Internet. It’s the governing body that manages the central repository of [[IP_Address]]es, the [[Domain_Name_System]] ([[DNS]]) and root servers. [[ICANN]] also coordinates the total supply of [[IP_address]]es. 
\
The organization emerged in 1998 to assist the US government and maintain the core infrastructure of the World Wide Web [[WWW]]. However, today, it works to standardize and run the entire naming system used on the web across the world.
\
[[ICANN]]’s role here is crucial. The organization keeps and manages the entire repository of IP addresses. It covers the entire globe that’s divided into five geographical regions, known as [[Regional_Internet_Registry]]s ([[RIR]]s):
\
-   The **American Registry for Internet Numbers** ([ARIN](https://www.ipxo.com/tutorial/what-is-arin/)) covers the US, Canada and some of the Caribbean Islands
-   The **Latin America and Caribbean Network Information Centre** ([LACNIC](https://www.ipxo.com/tutorial/lacnic-all-you-need-to-know/)) covers South America, Mexico and some of the Caribbean Islands
-   The **Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre** ([RIPE NCC](https://www.ipxo.com/tutorial/what-is-ripe-ncc/)) covers Europe, Greenland, Central Asia and the Middle East
-   The **African Network Information Centre** ([AFRINIC](https://www.ipxo.com/tutorial/what-is-afrinic/)) covers the continent of Africa
-   The **Asia Pacific Network Information Centre** ([APNIC](https://www.ipxo.com/tutorial/what-is-apnic/)) covers East Asia, the Indian subcontinent as well as the entire Pacific region
\
Each [[RIR]] is responsible for managing domain registrations and addresses for its region. ICANN uses [[IANA]], or the [[Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority]], to coordinate all IP addressing systems and [[Autonomous_System_Numbers]]. [[IANA]] functions as the system’s administrator that ensures every IP address is unique, but it doesn’t own the entire system.
