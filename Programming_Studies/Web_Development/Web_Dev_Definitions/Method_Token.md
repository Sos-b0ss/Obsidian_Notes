| 2    | **HEAD** Same as [[GET_Request]], but it transfers the status line and the header section only.                                                                                                       |
| 3    | **POST** A [[POST_Request]] is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using [[HTML]] forms.                                                        |
| 4    | **PUT** Replaces all the current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.                                                                                        |
| 5    | **DELETE** Removes all the current representations of the target resource given by [[URI]].                                                                                                   |
| 6    | **CONNECT** Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by a given [[URI]].                                                                                                                 |
| 7    | **OPTIONS** Describe the communication options for the target resource.                                                                                                                   |
