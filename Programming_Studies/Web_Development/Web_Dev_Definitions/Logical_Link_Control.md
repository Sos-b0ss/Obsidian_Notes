The [[Logical_Link_Control]] ([[LLC]]) is the upper sublayer of the [[Datalink_Layer]] in the [[Open_Systems_Interconnection]] ([[OSI-RM]]) reference model for data transmission. It acts act an interface between the [[Network_Layer]] and the [[Medium_Access_Control]] ([[MAC]]) sublayer of the [[Datalink_Layer]].
\
The [[LLC]] sublayer is mainly used for its [[Multiplex]]ing property. It allows several network protocols to operate simultaneously within a [[Multipoint_Network]], over the same network medium.
