Also known as [[Medium_Access_Control]]
\
[[MAC]] is responsible for the transmission of data [[Packets]] to and from the [[NIC]] ([[Network_Interface_Card]]), and to and from another remotely shared channel.
\
The basic function of [[MAC]] is to provide an addressing mechanism and channel access, so that each [[Node]] available on a network can communicate with other [[Node]]s available on the same or other networks. Sometimes people refer to this as the [[MAC]] layer.
\
In the [[IEEE]] 802 reference model of computer networking, the medium access control or media access control layer is the lower sublayer of the data link layer of the seven-layer [[OSI]] model.
