Markdown then, is just a way to create Web pages without the need (or even know how) to write [[HTML]] code. Actually, Markdown is an great way to format plain text even if you don’t have to convert to [[HTML]]. Someone once described Markdown to me this way:

> “It isn’t _what you see is what you get_, but _what you see is what you mean_”.

Markdown, however, is more than an easy formatting scheme, it is also a software tool that converts the plain text formatting to [[HTML]].
