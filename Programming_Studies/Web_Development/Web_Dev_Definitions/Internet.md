The internet is more simple than you'd think. A nice way to think about it is that the internet is like a Global version of your basic home network. It simply moves data from one place to another, so as to allow us to chat, browse and share information.
\
The Internet likes to use a method called 'packet switching' to move data from point A to B and back. All packet switching does, is cutting up your data into separate smaller pieces each tagged with the intended destination and a bit more info about where it came from. Once all the pieces reach their targets, they're smooshed back together to make that email you sent. [[Packets]] can flow through many different routes, each one determined by the quickest and most efficient at the time you make your request, sorta like neurons firing in a brain, and how electricity will always follow a path of least resistance. That's right, the internets basically a giant brain.
\
If instead of using packet switching, you tried to keep a permanent connection with your intended destination, or if say your bank account info was sent as a whole, that whole portion of the network would be blocked any time you sent that web request. So that'd mean no one else's info would make it anywhere if you were hogging all the bandwidth.
\
Treat it like a traffic jam on the high way because there's one single bus that was the whole width of the highway that people chose to walk through to get to where they wanted instead, how awful. But with packet switching, just imagine your car was switching with the car in front of you, so you could make your way forwards to get home after work, and turns out the person you switch spots with wanted to go back to where you were coming from, neat huh. 
\
That's packet switching in a nutshell, it essentially lets a whole lot more people to use the Internet at the same time, and its faster than you'd think.

There's countless of servers on the Internet, and servers store information either temporarily or permanently. There are servers for your files, for e-mail and web servers for sites like Google. The backbone of the Internet is all the routers that connect to it. With out getting too off topic, routers simply make all the connections between all the different systems in the Internet.
\
For instance, whether at home, School or work, where-ever several computers are networked together, your single device is really just connected to a router, that of which is also a singular point of entry for your Internet service provider.

Finer details about the Internet can be found in the explanation of the internet layer of the [[TCP-IP]] model:
\
"It is the second layer in the [[TCP]]/[[IP]] model, which is used for routing the packets across the internet and this layer has an Internet Protocol. IP protocol is connectionless and provides unreliable services, that’s why we use two more protocols for control and management purposes. Here you need to understand one thing, we have two connections when we talk about networking they are control connection and data connection. Data connection carries the data and control connection provides the control and management services for that particular network. Here IP is used for data connection and [[ICMP]] & [[IGMP]] used for the control connection. An [[ICMP]] & [[IGMP]] are both used for control and management purposes, they don’t involve actual data communications."
