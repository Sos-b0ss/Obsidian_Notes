The **Regional Internet Registry**, or [[RIR]], is a nonprofit organization that manages internet number resources within a geographical region. Five [[RIR]]s operate in five regions across the globe in total, including [AFRINIC](https://www.ipxo.com/tutorial/what-is-afrinic/), [APNIC](https://www.ipxo.com/tutorial/what-is-apnic/), [ARIN](https://www.ipxo.com/tutorial/what-is-arin/), [LACNIC](https://www.ipxo.com/tutorial/lacnic-all-you-need-to-know/) and [RIPE NCC](https://www.ipxo.com/tutorial/what-is-ripe-ncc/).
\
The resources that each RIR holds are allocated by the [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority](https://www.ipxo.com/tutorial/what-is-iana/) ([[IANA]]). However, [autonomous system numbers](https://www.ipxo.com/tutorial/what-is-asn/) ([[ASN]]s) and the [IPv4 and IPv6](https://www.ipxo.com/tutorial/ipv4-vs-ipv6/) address spaces are distributed by [[RIR]]s. That means that [internet service providers](https://www.ipxo.com/tutorial/what-is-isp/) ([[ISP]]) and end-users get their resources directly from Regional Internet Registries.
\
The [[Number_Resource_Organization]] ([[NRO]]) coordinates between all five [[RIR]]s with a mission to protect the unallocated address space. It also builds the policies pertaining to the distribution of internet number resources. Needless to say, many cogs run in the process of allocating [[ASN]]s and [[IP]]s.
