The data link layer is the protocol layer in a program that handles the moving of data into and out of a physical link in a network.
\
Functions of the [[Datalink_Layer]]:
- Handle problems that occur as a result of [[Bit_Transmission_Errors]].
- Ensure data flows at a pace that doesn't overwhelm sending and receiving devices.
- Permit the transmission of data to Layer 3, the [[Network_Layer]], where it is addressed and routed.
\
Data bits are encoded, decoded and organized in the data link layer, before they are transported as [[Frames]] between two adjacent nodes on the same [[LAN]] or [[WAN]]. The [[Datalink_Layer]] also determines how devices recover from collisions that may occur when [[Nodes]] attempt to send [[Frames]] at the same time.
\
The [[Datalink_Layer]] has two sublayers: the [[Logical_Link_Control]] ([[LLC]]) sublayer, and the [[Media_Access_Control]] [[MAC]] sublayer.
\
Two common MAC layer types include [Ethernet](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/Ethernet) and [802.11](https://www.techtarget.com/searchmobilecomputing/definition/80211) wireless specifications.
