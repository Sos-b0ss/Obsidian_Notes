An [[IP_Header]] contains important information about where a packet is from (its source [[IP_Address]]), where it is going (destination [[IP_Address]]), how large the packet is, and how long network routers should continue to forward the packet before dropping it. It may also indicate whether or not the packet can be fragmented, and include information about reassembling fragmented packets.
