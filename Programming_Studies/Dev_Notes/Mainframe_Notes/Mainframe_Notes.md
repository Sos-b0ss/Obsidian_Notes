Down and dirty useful details about learning Enterprise COBOL for mainframes (Comment pulled from reddit):

"COBOL has its own niche market. Not only does one need to know the language, but they need to also understand the platform. Not only is there Cobol on mainframe, there are other implementations on Unisys (clearpath), IBM SystemI (aka AS400), Openmvs and linux. Also, one needs to know the supporting frameworks such as, CICS, DB2, REXX, the various dataset (file) types, Job Control Language (JCL). And not to mention the familiarity of the Business Domain that's being supported (Banking, Government, Insurance, Marketing, Enterprise Transactions Processing Systems)"

Some tasty anecdotal Reddit inspiration (if you like money):

**Post was:**
"What does the wealthiest person you know do for work?"

**Top rated comment said:**
"A family friend retired after being a COBOL programmer for 30 years. About 2 years after his early retirement, a company came to him and said 'Name your salary' and he requested around $1.5 million/year thinking they'd scoff and leave him alone. He was instead hired on the spot and still works there because as he says it's more cozy than other SWE gigs."
