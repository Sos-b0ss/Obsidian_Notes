**Simple Explanation:**
\
Both stacks and queues are pretty similar and are kinda built on top of arrays but with a few additional features.
\
The stack is a 'Last in, First out' structure like a stack of cafe trays, the last one you put on top is going to be the first one you take off. When you add an item to the top its called `Push`ing (`.push(1)`), and then you `Pop` off the top item (`.pop()`). Every language keeps track of the functions that have been called with something called the [[Call_Stack]] ex. `((()))`. Stacks are also super important for an algorithm called [[DFS]], or [[Depth_First_Search]],  which will be ran into A LOT.
\
	The Queue on the other hand is a 'First in, First out', just like any queue or line that you normally have to wait in like at a concert. Adding an item to the end is called `enueue`ing (`.enqueue(1)`), and removing it from the front is called `dequeue`ing (`.dequeue()`). Queues are used for a really important algorithm called [[BFS]], or [[Breadth_First_Search]].

**Stack:**
**Pros:**
- Really efficient at adding and removing

**Cons:**
- limited use cases compared to other data structures
