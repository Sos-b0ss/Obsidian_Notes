**Simplified Explanation:**

A node is the atomic unit in linked lists. These contain a value, and a pointer. The value is something a simple as a number, say '55' and the pointer will simply connect you to the next node in the chain, hence the 'linked' in Linked List. The first node of the list is known as the head while the last one (which is the node with no next pointer) is known as the tail.
\
**Pros:**
- Good at adding new nodes and deleting nodes (Because you can just change where the next pointer is pointing)

**Cons:**
- Not very good at retrieving nodes, even when we know the index or searching (Because each node is only aware of the node next to it)
