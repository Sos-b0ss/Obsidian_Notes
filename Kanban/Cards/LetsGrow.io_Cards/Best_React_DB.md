\
Realm happens to be an open-source and object-oriented database that will function ten times faster than the relational database. Furthermore, it supports complex data types for offline and real-time applications. It does not require any object-related mapping or key-value store, and it comes with its search engine. The objects preserved within the Realm database will be able to access quite a few threads or sources.
\
Developers like to go for Realm database for enhancing the performance of React Native apps by dealing with large amounts of data. Realm, being a top-performing database, has proved that it can fix the queries better, unlike other databases such as SQLite. Put simply; this database happens to be the most preferred choice for large-size applications.
\
Even though Realm is an open-sourced platform, you need to pay $1750 each month for getting access to its advanced version. The Pro version will be featuring Realm Studio as well as other outstanding features for enterprises.
\
Advantages of using Realm
\
-   It comes with a fantastic set of APIs
-   It is offline-friendly with Redux off-line
-   It makes use of different encryption standards for each mobile platform
-   Its synchronization will go on running in the background, which will help to save user interaction
\
2. Firebase
\

\
Firebase is a database that is owned by Google having NoSQL. This database will be ideal for you if your application requires more offline updating of data and data synchronization. Firebase can manage React Native applications that are MVC-based, having high data specifications.
\
Furthermore, Firebase comes with performance monitoring tools that will allow you to evaluate a bug in your app. It provides you with complete access to data removal from the Google server as and when required.
\
The assessment process performed by Firebase happens to be ISO 27001 and SOC2, SOC1, and SOC3. The database can be used for free up to 1 GB, following which it will be imperative to shell out $25 for storing 2.5 GB of information.
\
Advantages of using Firebase
\
-   It will be possible to combine this database with any application easily
-   It aids in synchronizing data throughout various platforms
-   It helps to cache data on devices for providing access to users
-   It can address the roles of the users that will enable you to fix controls on file

3. SQLite
\
![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fea353a326a5c0a6f8a0b42a163951c2)
\
It was built originally to provide the users with the capacity to create local storage databases successfully for mobile applications. This database is quite light and does not require an extensive setup whatsoever. It can execute optimum SQL policies along with additional tools for managing the data easily. Even though there is some doubt regarding its performance quality, one will achieve better results in case he has encountered astounding database development. Everyone will be able to make use of SQLite source code free without any problem whatsoever.
\
Advantages of using SQLite
\
-   You can make use of its storage for enabling the off-line persistence in an application
-   It happens to be ACID compliant, and therefore, it can execute virtually every SQL standard
-   It helps in saving data in the cross-platform database file
\
4. PouchDB
\
![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7992a375d1aa33783a04728468494659)
\
Being an open-source Javascript database, PouchDB aids in preserving data in JSON format and allows all CRUD functions to be mutated and queried by using a JS API. PouchDB can enable apps to store data locally even when they are offline. Following this, sync the data with compatible servers and CouchDB once the app is online, keeping every user data synchronized irrespective of where they are logging in subsequently. This database is lightweight, being a dependency.
\
It aids in securing data for a React Native app very easily. It features a built-in authentication system intended for React Native and offers features such as password storing to safeguard encrypted keys from any degraded attack.
\
5. Async Storage
\
![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-afe8b8de8fae29b38a1b27ba2a2617d8-pjlq)
\
It is a regional storage framework that allows the developers to store information locally and retrieve it successfully between reboots of an app. Since this database comes with React Native inbuilt, you will be able to use it without deployment anymore. Async Storage will come of use to you even after closing the app or device whenever you are required to save the data the application needs to use.
\
6. WatermelonDB
\
![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-abfa7ae9dc3c1b29a02af1f28e39e796)
\
WatermelonDB was created for optimizing the React Native database. Being created on top of SQLite, it provides React Native Database with excellent performance. This database can scale a large number of records within 1 minute only. According to the official statement of Github, it has been optimized for generating tricky applications that emphasize real-world performance.
\
Being lazy, WatermelonDB makes use of slow end gadgets for managing data persistence. Moreover, as an outcome, it will not be possible for you to load any request if it has not been requested in the first place. Furthermore, it can handle multithreaded and highly cached async functions.

\
This happens to be amongst the most lightweight, fast, and open-source databases for creating React Native apps. Apart from being used for local data storage, the Vasern API is likewise employed for cloud storage and syncing across app users. Various open-source databases inspired its design and structures.
\
8. BerkeleyDB
\
![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-55274d9cea07a1e4eaa83c2bd1ffb924-lq)
\
BerkeleyDB is an open-source and top-performance backend intended for React Native that enables developers to manage data in various ways. It provides an API for various languages, including Android and iOS. It can handle data in several ways: using the Key/Value pair data or in a relational way similar to SQLite and supporting more than 1 data item for one key.
\
9. MongoDB
\
![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9e0200a8b9dd22bd3079dee8f63a2482)
\
This is a server-side database that has been created for large and complicated apps. Its primary approach will be to use a key-value store plus a relational database for storing objects with dynamic schemas in JSON documents. MongoDB provides a proper solution for React Native mobile applications, which are scalable.
\
You can get an idea of the pricing, which will depend on your specific cloud deployment on the official site of the database. If you don’t have much idea about cloud deployment, it will be a sensible idea to take the help of a professional development team to obtain a free quotation.
\
10. Amazon DynamoDB
\
![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d31f490b8c6a9dacb61b34078e731a69)
\
Being a NoSQL server-side database, Amazon DynamoDB was intended to operate on the Amazon Web Services cloud platform. This database is 100% decentralized, and not much administration will be required on it.
