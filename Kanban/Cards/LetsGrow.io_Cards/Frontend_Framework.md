React.js & Redux vs Node.js vs [[Svelte]] vs Solid.js
\
Might rather want to use [[TypeScript]] instead of react and node. Less buggy and more secure. Also using something like React is great when you're making a [[SPA]] but can bite you in the ass later if your [[JavaScript]] bundle is gigantic and anyone that's trying to use your web-app that has lost bandwidth is having to wait years for anything to load and is basically SOL when it comes to trying to use the tool at all.
