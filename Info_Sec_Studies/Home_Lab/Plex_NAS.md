Terramaster f2-221 intel x64 based NAS / PLEX Server:
\
The thing that sets this apart from other NAS devices is that it has in Intel x64 based processor with an onboard video processor. That makes this NAS capable of running a full PLEX server that can transcode 4K video on-the-fly. You can also run a home automation hub program (like HomeAssistant, or OpenHab) on this in a docker or virtualbox container. No need to have to learn and set up a raspberry Pi device. Of course, you can also use this as a central backup device for all the computers, tablets, and smartphones in the household.  
  \
One of the benefits of using a NAS for media and file storage is that it uses very little power -- around 30 watts, instead of the hundreds of watts desktop computers use, or the 90-120 watts laptop computers use, so it is affordable to leave the NAS on and available 24/7.  
  \
I have attached some details specs at the end of this posting.  
  \
The only reason I am selling it is that I upgraded to a 4 disk version. But if you load this with a couple of 18tb drives in a raid-1 redundant array, you will have 18 terabytes of storage available to store your entire audio, video, and photo archives -- all available for playback on any device connected to your network via PLEX or any other media server you choose to run. By running the drives in a redundant array, you pretty much eliminate the possibility of data loss, because if one drive fails, the data is still accessible on the other drive, and when you replace the bad drive, it will automatically rebuild the redundant array.
\
These sell new for around $260. If you want to get started with smaller drives, I can point you to a good deal on some good, fully tested 4tb HGST data center drives with 5 year warranties for around $45 per drive.

POWERFUL HARDWARE: 
\
Apollo J3355 2.0GHz dual-core CPU, and 2GB of RAM (expandable up to 4GB). Dual 1GbE LAN ports with each reaching at 119MB/s read and 118MB/s write (network failover / Link Aggregation supported).  
AES hardware encryption engine encrypts shared folders and network data transmission to keep data from unauthorized access.  
Advanced Btrfs file system offering 71,680 system-wide snapshots and 1,024 snapshots per shared folder.  
Real-time hardware transcoding of up to two concurrent 4K video streaming.  
Features an aluminum-alloy shell and intelligent temperature control ultra-quiet fan, good in heat dissipation. Compatible with 3.5" and 2.5" SATA HDD, 2.5" SATA SSD. For better and stable performance, please use dedicated NAS hard drives (or enterprise rated hard drives). Note, I load my NAS's with drives I shuck from Western Digital Elements external USB hard drives as these are less expensive than buying the bare drives, and are usually either NAS drives or enterprise drives in these USB cases. I wait for the sales on them and get them for a significant discount this way.
