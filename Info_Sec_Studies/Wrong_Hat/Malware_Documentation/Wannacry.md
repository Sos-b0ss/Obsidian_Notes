Started by Infecting a computer on a network and following its self propagation methods because that's what makes it a worm. Installed [[Cryptomalware]] to do [[Encryption]] of peoples files.

The [[WORM]]s job began on a machine that had already been infected by looking for other vulnerable systems on that machines network.

This [[WORM]] took advantage of a vulnerability in Microsoft's Server Message Block 1 ([[SMBv1]]) using the exploit [[EternalBlue]].

Once another vulnerable system was located by [[EternalBlue]] it would install a [[backdoor]] application called [[DoublePulsar]].

[[DoublePulsar]] then would download the [[Wannacry]] [[ransomware]] and began [[Encryption]] of the files on the victims computer.

This flow would continue until all the devices on the network had been infected and encrypted.
