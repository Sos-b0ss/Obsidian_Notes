[[Pdfresurrect]] is a tool aimed at analyzing PDF documents.  The PDF format allows
for previous document changes to be retained in a more recent version of the
document, thereby creating a running history of changes for the document.  This
tool attempts to modify the PDF so that a reading utility will be presented with
the previous versions of the PDF.  The modified "versions" will be generated
as new files leaving the original PDF unmodified.
