Core Impact isn't cheap (be prepared to spend at least $10,000), but it is widely considered to be the most powerful exploitation tool available. It sports a large, regularly updated database of professional exploits, and can do neat tricks like exploiting one machine and then establishing an encrypted tunnel through that machine to reach and exploit other boxes. Other good options include [Metasploit](https://sectools.org/tool/metasploit/) and [Canvas](https://sectools.org/tool/canvas/).
