Canvas is a commercial vulnerability exploitation tool from Dave Aitel's [ImmunitySec](http://www.immunitysec.com/). It includes more than 370 exploits and is less expensive than [Core Impact](https://sectools.org/tool/impact/) or the commercial versions of [Metasploit](https://sectools.org/tool/metasploit/). It comes with full source code, and occasionally even includes zero-day exploits.
