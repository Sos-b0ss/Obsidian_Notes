Sysinternals provides many small windows utilities that are quite useful for low-level windows hacking. Some are free of cost and/or include source code, while others are proprietary. Survey respondents were most enamored with:

-   [ProcessExplorer](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/utilities/ProcessExplorer.mspx) for keeping an eye on the files and directories open by any process (like lsof on UNIX).
-   [PsTools](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/utilities/PsTools.mspx) for managing (executing, suspending, killing, detailing) local and remote processes.
-   [Autoruns](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/utilities/Autoruns.mspx) for discovering what executables are set to run during system boot up or login.
-   [RootkitRevealer](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/utilities/RootkitRevealer.mspx) for detecting registry and file system API discrepancies that may indicate the presence of a user-mode or kernel-mode rootkit.
-   [TCPView](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/utilities/TcpView.mspx), for viewing TCP and UDP traffic endpoints used by each process (like Netstat on UNIX).

Many of the Sysinternals tools originally came with source code and there were even Linux versions. Microsoft [acquired Sysinternals](http://www.winternals.com/Company/PressRelease92.aspx) in July 2006, promising that “Customers will be able to continue building on Sysinternals' advanced utilities, technical information and source code”. Less than four months later, Microsoft [removed](http://seclists.org/dailydave/2006/q4/134) most of that source code.
