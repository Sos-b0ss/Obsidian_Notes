Kismet is a console (ncurses) based 802.11 layer-2 wireless network detector, sniffer, and intrusion detection system. It identifies networks by passively sniffing (as opposed to more active tools such as [NetStumbler](https://sectools.org/tool/netstumbler/)), and can even decloak hidden (non-beaconing) networks if they are in use. It can automatically detect network IP blocks by sniffing TCP, UDP, ARP, and DHCP packets, log traffic in [Wireshark](https://sectools.org/tool/wireshark/)/[tcpdump](https://sectools.org/tool/tcpdump/) compatible format, and even plot detected networks and estimated ranges on downloaded maps. As you might expect, this tool is commonly used for [wardriving](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving). Oh, and also [warwalking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwalking), [warflying](http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2002/08/warflying.ars), and [warskating](http://www.oldskoolphreak.com/tfiles/wifi/warskating/warskating.html), etc.
