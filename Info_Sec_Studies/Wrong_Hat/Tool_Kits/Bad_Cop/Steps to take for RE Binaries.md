There are plenty of non-protection specific things to learn: How to use a debugger, unpackers/packers, binary vs. hex/ASCII, API calls, x86 Assembly, and bitwise operations/logic (like what happens when you're XORing by 1, ANDing by 0, etc.) for starters. Then explore common methods for calculating checksums/CRCs.  
  
Then there's the various common forms of crypto: AES and RSA being used frequently.

Steps:
Google -> "Lenas Reversing for Newbies"  
or -> "SND Reversing Tutorials"  
(it's both the same).  
  
It contains the following stuff for beginners:
