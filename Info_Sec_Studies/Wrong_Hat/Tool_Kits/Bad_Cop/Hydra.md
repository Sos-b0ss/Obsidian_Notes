When you need to brute force crack a remote authentication service, Hydra is often the tool of choice. It can perform rapid dictionary attacks against more than 50 protocols, including telnet, ftp, http, https, smb, several databases, and much more. Like [THC Amap](https://sectools.org/tool/amap/) this release is from the fine folks at [THC](http://www.thc.org/). Other online crackers are [Medusa](https://sectools.org/tool/medusa/) and [Ncrack](http://nmap.org/ncrack/). The [Nmap Security Scanner](http://nmap.org/) also contains [many online brute force password cracking modules](http://nmap.org/nsedoc/categories/brute.html).
