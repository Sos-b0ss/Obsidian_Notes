sslstrip is an SSL stripping proxy, designed to make unencrypted HTTP sessions look as much as possible like HTTPS sessions. It converts https links to http or to https with a known private key. It even provides a padlock favicon for the illusion of a secure channel. Many HTTPS sites are normally accessed from a redirect on an HTTP page, and many users don't notice when their connection isn't upgraded.
