[[Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions]]
\
The primary risk with [[DNS]] is [[DNS]] poisoning, which can be achieved through sending spoofed [[DNS]] records to a [[DNS]] server in the hope that it will accept them as valid and present them to clients that request [[DNS]] information. Domain name system security extensions ([[DNSSEC]]) provide a suite of tools to ensure that the DNS structure is backed by valid digital signatures and trusted authorities.
