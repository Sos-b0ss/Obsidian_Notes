The New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) is a suite of protocols that provides authentication, integrity, and confidentiality in Windows systems. Through the use of a message digest hashing algorithm, they perform challenge/handshake integrations with users to check their credentials. There are three primary versions of NTLM:

- NTLM uses a simple MD4 hash
- NTLMv2 uses HMAC-MD5
- NTLM2 improves on NTLMv2 by adding mutual authentication
