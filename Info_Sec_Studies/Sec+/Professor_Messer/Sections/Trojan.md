Trojans are [[Malware]], and like most forms of [[Malware]], Trojans are designed to damage files, redirect internet traffic, monitor the user's activity, steal sensitive data or set up [[Backdoor]] access points ([[AP]]) to the system. [[Trojan]]s may delete, block, modify, leak or copy data, which can then be sold back to the user for ransom or on the dark web.

A Trojan Horse Virus is a type of [[Malware]] that downloads onto a computer disguised as a legitimate program. The delivery method typically sees an attacker use social engineering to hide malicious code within legitimate software to try and gain users' system access with their software.
