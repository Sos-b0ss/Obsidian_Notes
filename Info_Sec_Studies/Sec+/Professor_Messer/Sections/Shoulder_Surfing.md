Shoulder surfing is using direct observation techniques, such as looking over someone's shoulder, to get information. Shoulder surfing is an effective way to get information in crowded places because it's relatively easy to stand next to someone and watch as they fill out a form, enter a [[PIN]] at an ATM or pay for something using a credit card.

You have access to important information
- Many people want to see
- Curiosity, industrial espionage, competitive advantage

This is surprisingly easy for attackers to accomplish at:
- Airports / Flights
- Hallway-facing monitors
- coffee shops

Surf from afar:
- Binoculars / Telescopes
- webcam monitoring

Control your input by being aware of your surroundings, ie. use privacy filters to block viewing to anyone that isn't directly in front of the screen.
