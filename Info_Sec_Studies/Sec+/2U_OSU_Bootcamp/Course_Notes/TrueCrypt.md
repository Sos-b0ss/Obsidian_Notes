check out drive [[Encryption]] tool called "[[TrueCrypt]]" however this project has been abandoned for quite some time so now there's a tool called [[VeraCrypt]] that's being maintained and it's better.
Its similar to [[Bit_Locker]] but can be used on multiple [[OS]]es
it is also stronger than actual [[OS]] disk [[Encryption]].
