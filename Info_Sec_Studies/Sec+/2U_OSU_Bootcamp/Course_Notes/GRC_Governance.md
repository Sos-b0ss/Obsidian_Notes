Authenticate = prove identity (like user/pass, OTP, TOTP, or Biometrics)  
  
Authorize = used to provide access by using two step verification after being authorized. (Like user/pass>TOTP, Biometrics>OTP, or user/pass>Biometrics)  
  
Authorization often follows authentication.  
  
Think of it like: "I, have verified who you are because your ID is authentic. However you dont have the needed code word we use to authorize you to access this building"
