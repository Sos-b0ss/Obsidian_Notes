Both of these are great sources to get [[Rainbow_Tables]].

An optimized pre-built set of [[Hash]]es
- Saves time and space.
- Does not need to contain every single [[Hash]]. 
- Contains pre-calculated [[Hash]] chains.
- Challenge with rainbow tables is that each type of application or [[OS]] may use a different method to create that [[Hash]], so you would need a different type of rainbow table for every application or [[OS]].
