Tool is an application that provides security teams with visibility, threat hunting, automated detection, and Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows. Elastic SIEM is included in the default distribution of the most successful logging platform, Elastic (ELK) Stack software. It ships with out-of-the-box detection rules aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework to surface threats often missed by other tools. Created, maintained, and kept up-to-date by the security experts at Elastic, these rules automatically detect and address the latest threat activity. Severity and risk scores associated with signals generated by the detection rules enable analysts to rapidly triage issues and turn their attention to the highest-risk work.
