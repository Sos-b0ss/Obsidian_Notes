\
Password spraying is a type of brute force attack. In this attack, an attacker will brute force logins based on list of usernames with default passwords on the application.
\
Instead of trying to [[Brute_Force]] the password hashes some bad actors will instead just use a spray attack so as to avoid locking out an account for attempting too many incorrect login attempts.
\
This attack only attempts logon using the most common passwords just a few times before moving on to the next user.
\
Top 5 most common passwords:
1. 123456
2. 123456789
3. qwerty
4. password
5. 1234567
