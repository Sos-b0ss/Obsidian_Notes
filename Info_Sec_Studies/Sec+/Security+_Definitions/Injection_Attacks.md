This can be applied to so many different data types, including but not limited to:

- [[SQL]]
- [[XML]]

- [[DLL]]
- ...
\
[[SQL_Injection]]s are some of the most common forms of injection attacks.
\
Although [[DLL]] injections are very common as well, and can be used to have an application run the [[Malware]] as part of the programs process. This is dangerous because it allows the process of that software, no matter how high the privileges are for it, to run and access everything that the intended program would normally be able to.
