Credentialed Vulnerability Scan is a type of scanning technique where a secured scanning of the system is performed to analyze the [[process]]es, configurations, and vulnerabilities of the computer [[Network]]s . The mechanism of Credentialed Vulnerability Scan is adopted to strengthen the security of the computer system [[Network]].
\
A credentialed scan is when the scanner is given extra access, similar to the access an insider would have. Credentialed scans usually reveal more vulnerabilities, since they have more access, but the vulnerabilities revealed by non-credentialed scans are likely to be more serious since they are accessible even to unprivileged users.
