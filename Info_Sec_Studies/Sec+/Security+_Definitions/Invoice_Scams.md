In these scams, criminals send bills for goods or services the business never ordered or received. The scam succeeds mainly because the invoices look legitimate and unsuspecting employees don't look closely to see it's not real. They simply make the payment, thinking someone else in their company placed the order.

The scammer composes an email with an attached invoice that is disguising [[malware]] or [[ransomware]]. In some instances, the body of the email might even include specific details or vendor information, making it look like a work-related document. An employee receives the email and downloads the attachment, thinking it is legitimate.
