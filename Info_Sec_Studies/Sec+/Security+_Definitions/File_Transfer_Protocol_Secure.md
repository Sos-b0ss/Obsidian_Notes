[[FTP]] Secure is an extension of [[FTP]] and uses [[TLS]] to encrypt [[FTP]] traffic. Secure File Transfer Protocol is a secure implementation of [[FTP]] that uses [[SSH]] to transmit files in an encrypted format. Both methods are a significant improvement over [[FTP]], which is insecure due to the plaintext transmission of credentials.
