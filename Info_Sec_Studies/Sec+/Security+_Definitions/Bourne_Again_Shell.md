[[Bash]] is the free and enhanced version of the Bourne shell distributed with [[Linux]] and [[GNU]] operating systems. [[Bash]] is similar to the original, but has added features such as command-line editing. Created to improve on the earlier Bourne shell (named [[Sh]]), [[Bash]] includes features from the [[Korn_Shell]] and the [[C_Shell]].
