[[WPA]] and [[WPA2]] (both Personal and Enterprise) utilize a key management mechanism called the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol, or [[TKIP]]. [[TKIP]] provides the dynamic key management that addressed the key reuse problems in [[WEP]]. [[TKIP]] is primarily used for [[WPA]]-Personal now, since it is based on the [[RC4]] cipher, rather than the (assumed) more secure [[AES]].
