\
An access control list, with respect to a computer file system, is a list of permissions attached to an object. An [[ACL]] specifies which users or system processes are granted access to [[Object]]s, as well as what operations are allowed on given objects. Each entry in a typical [[ACL]] specifies a subject and an operation. 
\
For instance, if a file object has an [[ACL]] that contains, this would give Alice permission to read and write the file and Bob to only read it.
