One of the oldest file formats used by Microsoft applications. Besides having been the bread and butter for the Microsoft Office suite of applications for many years (Visio .vsd, Publisher .pub, Outlook .msg have not replaced [[CFBF]] files as their formats in the latest versions as of 2009) and almost all [[OLE]] applications that are capable of linking and embedding.
\
This file format also used to be used for a ton of other applications and environments like: Digital Image, [[SQL]] Server 2000 DTS packages, MSI packages, the Explorer Shell thumbnail cache, Internet Explorer [[RSS]] feeds, Rights Managements add-on for Internet Explorer as well as many third party application formats like [[AAF]] (a professional file interchange format designed for video post production and authoring), Kodak FlashPix photo file, [[CAD]] programs like [[Solid_Works]].

This diagram just goes to show that the [[OLE]] file format is actually a file format that contains a complete file system:

So this means each [[OLE]] file actually contains several Directories and files.
