The Portable Executable format is a file format for executables, [[Object]] code, [[DLL]]s and others used in 32-bit and 64-bit versions of [[Windows]] operating systems. The [[PE]] format is a data structure that encapsulates the information necessary for the [[Windows]] [[OS]] loader to manage the wrapped executable code.
