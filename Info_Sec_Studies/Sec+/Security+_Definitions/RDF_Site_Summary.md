[[RSS]] is a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format. Subscribing to [[RSS]] feeds can allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single news aggregator, which constantly monitor sites for new content, removing the need for the user to manually check them.
