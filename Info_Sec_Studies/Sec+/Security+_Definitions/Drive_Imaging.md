**Example:**
An administrator discovers an incident and confirms a web server has been compromised by an attacker. The attacker installed malware that has captured credit card information. The administrator pulled the hard drive to protect the evidence. If an affected hard drive is to be used as evidence, what should be done prior to any investigation?
\
Above all, forensically sound images of the drive and media must be captured. To do this, an exact bit-for-bit copy of the source drive is created using an imaging utility to eliminate the risk of the source drive being modified, and several images are created so that the original drive can be kept for proof.
