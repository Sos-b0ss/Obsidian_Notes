# Mean time to repair (MTTR)

## The maintenance metric that drives efficiency

[A practical guide to using MTTR and other metrics](https://lp.fiixsoftware.com/metrics)

## What is MTTR?

[[MTTR]] is a maintenance metric that measures the average time required to [troubleshoot](https://www.fiixsoftware.com/blog/6-types-of-maintenance-troubleshooting-techniques/) and repair failed equipment. It reflects how quickly an organization can respond to unplanned breakdowns and repair them.
\
[[MTTR]] calculates the period between the start of the incident and the moment the system returns to production. This takes into account the time to:

1.  Notify technicians
2.  Diagnose the issue
3.  Fix the issue
4.  Allow the equipment to cool down
5.  Reassemble, align, and calibrate the asset
6.  Set up, test, and start up the asset for production

This metric does not take into account lead time for parts.
\
Identifies the average (arithmetic mean) time it would require to restore operations in a failed system. Sometimes referred to as the mean time to repair, this figure is often given in contracts with system providers. In the event of a failure, the provider promises to restore functionality within a given amount of time.
