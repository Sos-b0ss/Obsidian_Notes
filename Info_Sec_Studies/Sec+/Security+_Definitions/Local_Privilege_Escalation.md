Privilege escalation means users receive privileges they are not entitled to. These privileges can be used to delete files, view private information, or install unwanted programs such as [[Virus]]es. It usually occurs when a system has a [[Bug]] that allows security to be bypassed or, alternatively, has flawed design assumptions about how it will be used.
