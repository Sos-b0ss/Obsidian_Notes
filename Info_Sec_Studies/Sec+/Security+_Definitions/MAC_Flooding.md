[[MAC]] Flooding is an attack in which attackers overflow the [[MAC]] address table of a switch and use that to steal sensitive data from hosts connected to the switch. Attackers can also use [[MAC]] Flooding to perpetrate a [[Man-in-the-Middle]] attack by link the [[MAC]] address of a malicious device with the [[IP_Address]] of a legitimate host.
