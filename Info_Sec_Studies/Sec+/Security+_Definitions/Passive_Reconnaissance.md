Passive reconnaissance makes use of the vast amount of information available on the web. When one is conducting passive reconnaissance, one is not interacting directly with the target and as such, the target has no way of knowing, recording, or logging activity. The reconnaissance is aimed at collecting as much information as possible on a target.
\
This is generally the first step of any cyber attack since it allows the attacker to collect information without the potential of alerting the victim of the attack. Active reconnaissance, on the other hand, bears the risk of alerting the target of the attack.
