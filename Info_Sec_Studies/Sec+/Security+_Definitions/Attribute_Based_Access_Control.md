\
Attribute-based access control, also known as policy-based access control for [[IAM]], defines an access control paradigm whereby a subject's authorization to perform a set of operations is determined by evaluating attributes associated with the subject, [[Object]], requested operations, and, in some cases, [[Environment_Attribute]]s.
\
[[ABAC]] can provide fine-grained and contextual access control, which allows for a higher number of discrete inputs into an access control decision, providing a bigger set of possible combinations of those variables to reflect a larger and more definitive set of possible rules, policies, or restrictions on access.
