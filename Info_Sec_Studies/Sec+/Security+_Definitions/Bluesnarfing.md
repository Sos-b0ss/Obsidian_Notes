BlueSnarfing is the illegal theft of information from Bluetooth enabled devices. Using BlueSnarfing, attackers can take advantage of the security vulnerabilities of Bluetooth software, and access [[Bluetooth]]-enabled devices illegally, without the consent of the owners of the devices.

Bluesnarfing is a hacking technique that exploits Bluetooth connections to snatch data from a wireless device. An attacker can perform bluesnarfing when the Bluetooth function is on and your device is discoverable by other devices within range. In some cases, attackers can even make calls from their victim's phone.

Bluetooth enabled devices communicate with eachother using a protocol called [[OBEX]] or OBject EXchange. Bluesnarfing uses security vulnerabilities from that protocol. In bluesnarfing, the attacker first scans for [[Bluetooth]]-enabled devices, especially in public places. Then they pair with a device without the user's consent. The attackers usually use some software to do bluesnarfing. This software enables them to get illegal access to that device, using which they can access the information stored on the device.
