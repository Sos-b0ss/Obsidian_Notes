An [[ML]]Â algorithm, which is a part of [[AI]], uses an assortment of accurate, probabilistic, and upgraded techniques that empower computers to pick up from the past point of reference and perceive hard-to-perceive patterns from massive, noisy, or complex datasets.
\
Some of the most common [[ML]] algos are:
- [[Linear_Regression]]
- [[Logistic_Regression]]
- [[K-Nearest_Neighbors]]
- [[Support_Vector_Machines]]
- [[Naive_Bayes_Algorithm]]
- [[Decision_Tree]]
- [[Random_Forest]]
- [[K-means_Clustering]]
