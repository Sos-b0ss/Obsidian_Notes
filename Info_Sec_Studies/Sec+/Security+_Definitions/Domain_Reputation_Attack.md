The key difference is that [[IP]] and domain reputation is applied to incident response and threat intelligence, and also indicates whether an [[IP]] or domain has been associated with any nefarious activity. So, why should you care? Well, if your system is compromised, it might be used in attacks against other organizations.

[[IP]] reputation is a system that rates the trustworthiness of an [[IP]] address based on its past behaviour. This system is used by various organizations to decide whether to accept traffic from an [[IP]] address. A good [[IP]] reputation is important for ensuring that your website or service is not blocked by major [[ISP]]s or blacklisted by security companies.
