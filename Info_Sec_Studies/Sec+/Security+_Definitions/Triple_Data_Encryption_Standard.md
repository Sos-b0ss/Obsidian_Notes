\
An implementation of the data encryption standard ([[DES]]) algorithm that uses three passes of the [[DES]] algorithm instead of one as used in ordinary [[DES]] applications. Triple [[DES]] provides much stronger encryption than ordinary [[DES]] but it is less secure than advanced encryption standard ([[AES]]).
