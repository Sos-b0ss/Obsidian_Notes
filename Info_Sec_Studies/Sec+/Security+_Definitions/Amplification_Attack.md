An amplification attack is a form of [[DDoS]] wherein the attacker essentially exploits vulnerabilities in the networking protocols to significantly increase the impact of the attack. In this example, the attacker performed a [[Smurf_Attack]] via PING ([[ICMP]]) The attacker configures the [[PING]] [[Packets]] to be sent to every host on the network, while spoofing the originating [[IP]] address so that all the responses are sent to the spoofed address to be overwhelmed ([[Spoofing]]).
