Lateral movement is a key tactic that distinguishes today's advanced persistent threats ([[APT]]s) from simplistic cyberattacks of the past. Lateral movement allows a [[Threat_Actor]] to avoid detection and retain access, even if discovered on the machine that was first infected.
\
While some aspects of it may be automated, lateral movement is often a manual process directed by an attacker or group of attackers. This hands-on approach enables attackers to tailor their methods to the [[Network]] in question. It also allows them to respond quickly to security countermeasures applied by [[Network]] and security administrators.
