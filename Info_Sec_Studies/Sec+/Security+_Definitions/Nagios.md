Nagios provides security experts with the ability to monitor networks and connected hosts and systems in real-time. The tool outputs an alert to users once it identifies security problems in a network. However, users can opt for the notification alerts they want to receive. Nagios can monitor network services such as [[SMTP]], [[NNTP]], [[ICMP]], [[POP3]], [[HTTP]], and many others.
