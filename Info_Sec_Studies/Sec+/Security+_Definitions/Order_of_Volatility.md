The order of volatility ([[OOV]]) can be summarized as the life expectancy of various types of captured data during forensic analysis. For example, CDs and DVDs have a lifetime of tens of years, while [[USB]] and tape drives have a length of years. Data stored in the [[CPU]], [[RAM]], or [[Cache]]s is used and deleted within seconds, so these types of data are very volatile.
