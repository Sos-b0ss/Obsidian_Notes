[[Cross-site_Request]]s are common and legitimate, they can be anything from:
- A browser loading a video once a websites front page loads
- A browser loading text from a websites server
- Visiting the website at all

[[Cross-Site_Request_Forgery]] are common ways that attackers will manipulate the data request process, as if they're telling say a banking website to transfer the $3000 to their bank account number rather than the one that you entered in.

This type of attack is also commonly called a "one-click attack" or "session riding", It will also very commonly be abbreviated to:
- [[XSRF]]
- [[CSRF]]
- [[Sea_Surf]]

There is also a way that attackers are able to process this without the victim's interaction in any way.

This would be called an [[SSRF]]:

[[Server-side_Request_Forgery]]
