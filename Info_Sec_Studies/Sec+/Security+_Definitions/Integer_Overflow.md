\
An integer overflow is a type of an [[Arithmetic_Overflow_Error]] when the result of an integer operation does not fit within the allocated memory space. Instead of an error in the program, it usually causes the result to be unexpected.
\
Integer overflow can result, for example, in a request for dynamically allocated memory that is far too large or too small than that which is needed by the program. An integer overflow often passes undetected by the affected application. Because of this, the condition may lead to a security breach through a [[Buffer_Overflow]] or other malicious code.
