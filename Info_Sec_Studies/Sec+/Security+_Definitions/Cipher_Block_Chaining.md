\
In [[Cypher]] block chaining, each [[Cypher]] text block is decrypted in a process that requires observing the blocks that have already been processed. The [[Cypher]] block chaining process uses a logical gate called [[XOR]] to administer this process of observation.
\
[[Cypher]] block chaining is often suggested as a stronger method of decryption, ensuring quality. However, some experts warn against certain vulnerabilities of [[Cypher]] block chaining, including the use of predictable [[Initialization_Vector]]s.
\
In a [[Cypher]] block chaining process, data is encrypted in specific blocks, and each block is dependent on the blocks before it for decryption. The process uses something called an [[Initialization_Vector]] to help tie these blocks of encrypted data together.
