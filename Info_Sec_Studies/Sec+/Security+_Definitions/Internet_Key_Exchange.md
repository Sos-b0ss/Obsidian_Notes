\
In computing, Internet Key Exchange is the protocol used to set up a security association in the [[IPsec]] protocol suite. [[IKE]] builds upon the Oakley protocol and [[ISAKMP]]. 
\
[[IKE]] uses X.509 certificates for authentication ‒ either pre-shared or distributed using [[DNS]] ‒ and a [[Diffie–Hellman]] key exchange to set up a shared session secret from which cryptographic keys are derived. In addition, a security policy for every peer which will connect must be manually maintained.
