\
Time-based One-time Password is a computer algorithm that generates a one-time password that uses the current time as a source of uniqueness. As an extension of the [[HMAC]]-based One-time Password algorithm, it has been adopted as Internet Engineering Task Force standard RFC 6238. [[TOTP]] is the cornerstone of Initiative for Open Authentication, and is used in a number of two-factor authentication systems.
\
**There are various methods available for the user to receive a time-based one-time password, including:**
-   hardware security tokens which display the password on a small screen;
-   mobile authenticator apps, such as Google Authenticator;
-   text messages sent from a centralized server;
-   email messages sent from a centralized server;
-   voice messages sent from a centralized server.
