CryptojackingÂ (also called malicious [[Cryptomining]]) is an online threat that hides on a computer or mobile device and uses the machine's resources to "mine" forms of online currency known as cryptocurrencies. Malicious [[Cryptominers]] often come through web [[Browser]] downloads or [[Rogue_Mobile_App]]s.
