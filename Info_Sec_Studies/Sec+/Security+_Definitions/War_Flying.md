Warflying or warstorming is an activity consisting of using an airplane or [[Drones]] and a Wi-Fi-equipped computer, such as a router, laptop or a smartphone/PDA, to detect [[Wi-Fi]] wireless [[Network]]s. Warstorming shares similarities to [[Wardriving]] and [[Warwalking]] in all aspects except for the method of transport.
