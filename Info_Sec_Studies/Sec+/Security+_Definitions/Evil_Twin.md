An attacker can easily create an evil twin with a smartphone or other internet-capable device and some easily available software.

An evil twin attack is an attack where a hacker sets up a fake [[Wi-Fi]] [[Network]] that looks like a legitimate access point to steal victims' sensitive details. Most often, the victims of such attacks are ordinary people like you and me. The attack can be performed as a man-in-the-middle ([[MITM]]) attack.
