[[CUDA]] is a parallel computing language, a version of the '[[C]]' programming language with special NVidia extensions, developed by NVidia for their [[GPU]]s from the G8X and up.

NVidia graphics cards such as this GeForce model are being pressed into service to provide extra processing capacity — and now audio software producers are getting in on the act. It works with their GeForce, Quadro and Tesla graphics cards, and will apparently run without modification on all future NVidia graphics cards. The beauty of the [[GPU]] is that, unlike the dual or quad‑core format of today's standard PCs, it has a "parallel many‑core architecture, each core capable of running thousands of threads simultaneously”.
