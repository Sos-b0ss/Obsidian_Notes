The [[TACACS+]] is produced by Cisco as an alternative to [[RADIUS]]. Through encryption of the entire authentication process, and multiple challenges and responses between the server and client, [[TACACS+]] provides enhanced security over [[RADIUS]]. Furthermore, [[TACACS+]] can interface with a Microsoft Active Directory environment for authentication purposes.
