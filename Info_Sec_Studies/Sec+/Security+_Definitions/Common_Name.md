Also known as the Fully Qualified Domain Name ([[FQDN]]), it is the characteristic value within a distinguished name ([[DN]]). Typically it is composed of a Host Domain Name and looks something like, "www.google.com", or "google.com". Before enrolling for a certificate, you must generate a certified signing request from your web server. While generating a [[CSR]] you will be required to enter information in the Common Name field. [[CN]]s are issued at the Host level.
