\
A brute force attack is a hacking method that uses trial and error to crack passwords, login credentials, and [[Encryption]] keys. It is a simple yet reliable tactic for gaining unauthorized access to individual accounts and organizations' systems and networks.
\
Tries every combination of possible passwords until they discover the matching [[Hash]]. 
- Takes a very long time
- If the attack is waged online often times the user gets locked out fairly quickly, so its more common to take the attack offline by extracting the users password hash and then cracking it locally.
