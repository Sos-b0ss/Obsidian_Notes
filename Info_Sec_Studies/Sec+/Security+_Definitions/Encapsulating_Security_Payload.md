\
[[ESP]] or Encapsulation security [[Payload]] is an individual protocol in [[IPSec]]. [[ESP]] is responsible for the [[CIA]] triad of security ([[Confidentiality]], [[Integrity]], [[Availability]]), which is considered significant only when encryption is carried along with them. Securing all payload/[[packets]]/content in [[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]] is the responsibility of [[ESA]].
\
[[ESP]] protocol provides data confidentiality, and also optionally provides data origin [[Authentication]], data [[Integrity]] checking, and replay protection.
