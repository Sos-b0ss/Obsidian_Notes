Vendor risk assessment is the process of risk analysis in the entire production cycle. It is also known as third-party risk management. Threats and risks need to be correctly monitored as this can affect your company's [[Network]] security, business continuity plans, data privacy, reputation, and digital assets.

A vendor management policy is a set of internal standards that dictate how a company will protect itself from cyber-attacks originating through third party vendor [[Network]]s. This formal policy typically includes thorough documentation and a plan to implement controls across the organization.
