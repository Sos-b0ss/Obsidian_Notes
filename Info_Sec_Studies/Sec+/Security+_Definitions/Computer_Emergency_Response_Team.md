A [[CERT]] is a group of information security experts responsible for the protection against, detection of and response to an organization’s cybersecurity incidents. A [[CERT]] may focus on resolving incidents such as data breaches and [[DoS]] attacks as well as providing alerts and incident handling guidelines. Regardless of whether they are called a [[CERT]], [CSIRT], IRT or any other similar name, the role of all computer emergency response teams is fairly comparable.
