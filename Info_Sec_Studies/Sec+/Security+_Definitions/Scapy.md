[[Scapy]] is a powerful interactive packet manipulation tool, packet generator, network scanner, network discovery tool, and Packet [[Sniffer]]. Note that [[Scapy]] is a very low-level toolâ€”you interact with it using the [[Python]] programming language. It provides classes to interactively create [[Packets]] or sets of packets, manipulate them, send them over the wire, sniff other packets from the wire, match answers and replies, and more.
