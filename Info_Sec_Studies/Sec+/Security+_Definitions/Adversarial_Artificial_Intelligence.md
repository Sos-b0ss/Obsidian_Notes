According to Ian Goodfellow et al., writing for Open AI, adversarial examples are crafted inputs intentionally designed to cause a learning model to make a mistake. Vendors and defending organizations can defend against malicious [[AML]] by generating many adversarial examples and then training the [[ML]] model to manage them properly.

Adversarial [[AI]] is the malicious development and use of advanced digital technology and systems that have intellectual processes typically associated with human behaviour. These include the ability to learn from past experiences, and to reason or discover meaning from complex data. Changes in the threat landscape are already apparent.
