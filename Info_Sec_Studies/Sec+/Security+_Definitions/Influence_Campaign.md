Influence campaigns represent a dangerous new paradigm in cybersecurity. They are secretive and deniable, difficult to attribute, and severely influence public opinion. Influence campaigns are also used in so-called "[[Hybrid_Warfare]]," where traditional warfare techniques are combined with hacking and the previously mentioned influence campaigns.
\
An influence campaign is the coordinated, combined, and synchronized application of diplomatic, informational, military, and economic abilities, together with other national capabilities, whether in times of peace, periods of crisis, hostile situations, or following hostilities.
