[[CCMP]] is an enhanced data cryptographic encapsulation mechanism designed for data confidentiality and based upon the Counter Mode with [[CBC-MAC]] ([[CCM_Mode]]) of the Advanced Encryption Standard ([[AES]]) standard. It was created to address the vulnerabilities presented by Wired Equivalent Privacy ([[WEP]]), a dated, and insecure protocol.
