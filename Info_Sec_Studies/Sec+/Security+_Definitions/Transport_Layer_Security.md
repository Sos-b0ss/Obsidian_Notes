Transport Layer Security is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network. The protocol is widely used in applications such as email, instant messaging ([[IM]])
, and voice over [[IP]], but its use in securing [[HTTPS]] remains the most publicly visible.
\
Transport Layer Security, or [[TLS]], is a widely adopted security protocol designed to facilitate privacy and data security for communications over the Internet. A primary use case of [[TLS]] is encrypting the communication between web applications and servers, such as web browsers loading a website.
\
[[TLS]] are designed to provide security at the transport layer. [[TLS]] was derived from a security protocol called Secure Socket Layer ([[SSL]]) . [[TLS]] ensures that no third party may eavesdrop or tampers with any message.
