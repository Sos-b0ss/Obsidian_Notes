Example: 
\
Two organizations, Smith Consulting and Smith Manufacturing, work together under a larger umbrella corporation, Smith Industrial Services. Though they are separate companies, they are connected through the owners organization's network and thus are able to share resources with each other. The user accounts in one organization are able to access resources of the sister organization without needing additional accounts. 
\
Because there is a two-way trust between the sister organizations and their parent organization, a transitive trust exists between two sister organizations. This reduces the administrative overhead from an IT management perspective and enables users to share access in separate organizations without the need for additional configurations.
