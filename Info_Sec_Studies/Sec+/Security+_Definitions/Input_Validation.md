Input validation is a programming technique that ensures only properly formatted data may enter a software system component. It is always recommended to prevent attacks as early as possible in the processing of the user's (attacker's) request. Input validation can be used to detect unauthorized input before it is processed by the application.
\
For web applications, input validation usually means verifying user inputs provided in web forms, query parameters, uploads, and so on. Missing or improper input validation is a major factor in many web security vulnerabilities, including cross-site scripting ([[XSS]]) and [[SQL]] injection.
