In its simplest terms, the Dark Web is part of the internet that is only accessible using a special web browser (such as Tor) that allows users and website operators to remain anonymous or untraceable. Accessing the Dark Web is not difficult. You can download Tor or another browser and be on the Dark Web within minutes.

The dark web is a version of the internet that allows for anonymous usage. It functions the same way that the internet does, except that activity isn't indexed in the search engines you use, allowing you to conduct activities that are not monitored by any governing entity.

The dark web is a network of unindexed web content. The biggest differentiator between the deep and dark web is that dark web activity is made anonymous through a variety of encryption and routing techniques. The dark web is also unregulated, meaning that it is run and upheld by a vast network of individuals around the world.
\
The Dark Web (also called The Dark Net) is a network within the Internet which is only accessible using certain software and protocols. The Dark Web has many names, for example Tor Network or Onion Router. Anyone can access to the Dark Web by simply downloading software for it. A popular and very much used browser is the Tor Project's Tor Browser
