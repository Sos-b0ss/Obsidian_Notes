[[The_Sleuth_Kit]] (previously known as [[TSK]]) is a collection of [[UNIX]]-based command line file and [[Volume]] system [[Forensics]] analysis tools. The file system tools allow you to examine file systems of a suspect computer in a non-intrusive fashion. Because the tools do not rely on the operating system [[OS]] to process the file systems, deleted and hidden content is shown. A graphical interface to the tools called [[Autopsy]] is available.
