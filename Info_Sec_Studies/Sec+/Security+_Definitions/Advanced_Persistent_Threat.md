An [[APT]] is a serious threat to organizational security; these can be some of the most well-funded and organized. [[APT]]s are sometimes sponsored by governments or nation-states, and this provides them with virtually unlimited funding and manpower to accomplish their espionage objectives. For example, China has a well-known group, Unit 61398 of the People's Liberation Army ([[PLA]]), that consists of hundreds of individuals and over a thousand servers all hacking organizations, distributing malware, and performing a multitude of other cyber-espionage efforts.
