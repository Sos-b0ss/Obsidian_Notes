In cryptography, PBKDF1 and [[PBKDF2]] are key derivation functions with a sliding computational cost, used to reduce vulnerabilities of brute-force attacks. PBKDF2 is part of [[RSA]] Laboratories' Public-Key Cryptography Standards series, specifically PKCS #5 v2.0, also published as Internet Engineering Task Force's RFC 2898.

Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 ([[PBKDF2]]) makes it harder for someone to guess your account password through a [[Brute_Force]] attack. [[PBKDF2]] prevents password cracking tools
