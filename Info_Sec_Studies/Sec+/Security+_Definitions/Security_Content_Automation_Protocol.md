The Security Content Automation Protocol is a method for using specific standards to enable automated vulnerability management, measurement, and policy compliance evaluation of systems deployed in an organization, including e.g., [[FISMA]] compliance. The [[National_Vulnerability_Database]] is the U.S. government content repository for [[SCAP]]. An example of an implementation of [[SCAP]] is OpenSCAP.
