Network vulnerability scanning is an inspection of the potential points of exploit on a computer or [[Network]] to identify security holes. A vulnerability scan detects and classifies system weaknesses in computers, [[Network]]s and communications equipment and predicts the effectiveness of countermeasures.
\
Managing exposure to known cybersecurity vulnerabilities is the primary responsibility of a vulnerability manager. Although vulnerability management involves more than simply running a scanning tool, a high-quality vulnerability tool or toolset can dramatically improve the implementation and ongoing success of a vulnerability management program.
