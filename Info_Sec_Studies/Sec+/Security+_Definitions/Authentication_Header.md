\
[[AH]] is used to provide integrity and authentication to [[IP_Datagram]]. Replay protection is also possible. The services are connectionless, that means they work on a per-packet basis.
\
[[AH]] is used in two modes as follows:
- [[Transport_Mode_Authentication_Header]] 
- [[Tunnel_Mode_Authentication_Header]]

[[AH]] authenticates are the same as [[IP_Datagram]].
