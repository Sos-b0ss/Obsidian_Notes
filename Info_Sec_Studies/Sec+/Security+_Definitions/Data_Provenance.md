The term "[[Data_Provenance]]", sometimes called "[[Data_Lineage]]," refers to a documented trail that accounts for the origin of a piece of data and where it has moved from to where it is presently. The purpose of data provenance is to tell researchers the origin, changes to, and details supporting the confidence or validity of research data.
\
Data provenance is the documentation of where a piece of data comes from and the processes and methodology by which it was produced. Put simply, provenance answers the questions of why and how the data was produced, where, when and by whom.
