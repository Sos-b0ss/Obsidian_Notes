File Allocation Table ([[FAT]]) is a file system that was developed by Microsoft to support small disks and simple folder structures. The file system is named File Allocation Table because it uses a table to track the [[Clusters]] on a [[Storage_Volume]], as well as how those clusters are linked together through their associated files and directories.
