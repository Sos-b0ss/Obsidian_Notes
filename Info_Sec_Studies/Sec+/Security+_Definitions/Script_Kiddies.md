Hobbyists, sometimes known as “script kiddies,” are frequently inexperienced hackers who act alone and with limited financial resources. Hobbyists are essentially “interested” in technology; their motives typically revolve around enhancing their reputation by identifying and exploiting technical system flaws. But what types of cyberattacks do amateurs carry out? There are several low-level attacks, after all. This comprises:

-   Website vandalism is essentially online graffiti.
-   Denial of service attacks prevents a particular application server from providing its services by bombarding the target with so many packets that it is unable to react.
-   By fooling the database into changing the URL, a SQL injection attack essentially exposes more content than was intended to be displayed.

Script kiddies are actors who rely on scripts they can receive from other sources since they lack the ability to develop their own dangerous programs. Both insiders and outsiders may qualify as these. It was once believed that teens were the main drivers of script kids through peer pressure or mere mischief.

Script kids can be highly tenacious in carrying out their attacks and, like hacktivists, use a number of technologies at their disposal as well as social engineering strategies. Script kids provide a threat on par with any hostile actor due to the ease with which hacking resources and knowledge are made available and the ongoing evolution of tools.
