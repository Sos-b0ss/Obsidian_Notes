Electronic serial numbers were created by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to uniquely identify mobile devices, from the days of [[AMPS]] in the United States starting in the early 1980s. The administrative role was taken over by the Telecommunications Industry Association in 1997 and is still maintained by them.
