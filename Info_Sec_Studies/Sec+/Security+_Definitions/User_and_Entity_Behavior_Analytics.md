[[Info_Sec_Studies/Acronyms/UEBA]], is a type of cyber security process that takes note of the normal conduct of users. In turn, they detect any anomalous behavior or instances when there are deviations from these “normal” patterns. For example, if a particular user regularly downloads 10 MB of files every day but suddenly downloads gigabytes of files, the system would be able to detect this anomaly and alert them immediately. 
\
[[Info_Sec_Studies/Acronyms/UEBA]] uses machine learning, algorithms, and statistical analyses to know when there is a deviation from established patterns, showing which of these anomalies could result in a potential, real threat. [[Info_Sec_Studies/Acronyms/UEBA]] can also aggregate the data you have in your reports and logs, as well as analyze file, flow, and packet information.

In [[Info_Sec_Studies/Acronyms/UEBA]], you do not track security events or monitor devices; instead, you track all the users and entities in your system. As such, UEBA focuses on insider threats, such as employees who have gone rogue, employees who have already been compromised, and people who already have access to your system and then carry out targeted attacks and fraud attempts, as well as servers, applications, and devices that are working within your system.
