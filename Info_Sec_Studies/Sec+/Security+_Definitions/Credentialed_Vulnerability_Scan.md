Vulnerability scans can be run using two methods. One is a non-credentialed scan, which means it would not have any privileges and n immediate access to the elements it is scanning. This emulates the conditions an attacker would experience. Some vulnerability testing tools can perform privilege escalation as vulnerabilities are discovered. A credentialed vulnerability scan operates as if it had a user account, and can even be assigned administrator privileges in order to provide a deeper and more thorough scan.
