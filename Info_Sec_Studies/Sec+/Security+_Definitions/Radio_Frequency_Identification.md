There is not much to gain from attempting to escalate privilege's in an [[RFID]] tag environment, as it is potentially one of thousands with nonspecial permissions or privileges. Conversely, because the [[RFID]] tags transmit data over the air, it is possible for an attacker to intercept the communications and interpret the data. A replay attack could be used to spoof an [[RFID]] tag, enabling an attacker to steal the package. A denial of service ([[DoS]]) attack could be performed to take down the [[RFID]] network if the attacker knew the frequency of the system.

RFID is a type of Automatic Identification and Data Capture technology. [[AIDC]] technologies are used to collect and upload data that is embedded in objects. An RFID system relies on radio waves. Electromagnetic fields transmit digital data from an RFID tag — that's either embedded inside or attached to an object — to an RFID reader.
