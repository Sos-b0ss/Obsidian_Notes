The cyber fusion approach focuses on integrating threat intelligence across all security aspects of an organization to tackle the targeted threats. This strategy allows security teams to contextualize insights into malicious activities and meaningfully orchestrate cybersecurity operations across the [[Network]].
\
Cyber fusion is a unique approach to cybersecurity that combines several security functions such as threat intelligence, incident response, security automation, security orchestration, and others into a single connected unit. This provides an unprecedented level of collaboration across security teams for threat or incident detection and response.
