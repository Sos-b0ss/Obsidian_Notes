A bug bounty is a monetary reward given to ethical hackers for successfully discovering and reporting a vulnerability or bug to the application's developer. Bug bounty programs allow companies to leverage the hacker community to improve their systems' security posture over time continuously.

According to AT&T Cybersecurity, creator of [[Open_Threat_Exchange]] [[OTE]], the largest crowdsourced computer security platform, "[[Bug]] Bounty programs allow [[White-hat]] hackers and security researchers to find vulnerabilities within a corporation's (approved) ecosystem and are provided recognition and/or monetary reward for disclosing them."
