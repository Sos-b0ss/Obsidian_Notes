Magnetic hard drives are rendered completely unreadable with the use of a degausser. This very powerful magnet is passed over the magnetic drive, or tape, which completely realigns the molecules and renders it physically inoperable. This is done in cases where the hard drive will not be reused again and needs to be disposed of in a way that is absolutely irrecoverable.
