The [[Z_Shell]] is a [[Unix]] shell that can be used as an interactive login shell and as a command interpreter for shell scripting. [[Zsh]] is an extended Bourne shell with many improvements, including some features of [[Bash]], [[Ksh]], and [[Tcsh]].
\
[[Z_Shell]] isÂ touted as a great alternative to [[Bash]] and all other [[Shell]]s. The [[Shell]] has many of the features, if not all of [[Bash]] but with enhancements. It is better, according to its fans, at [[Globbing]], editing commands and menu completion features. If you start hopping from bash to other solutions, check out [[Z_Shell]] and see if you like it.
