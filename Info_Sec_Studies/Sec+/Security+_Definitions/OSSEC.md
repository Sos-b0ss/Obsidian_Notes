OSSEC is an [[Open_Source]] cybersecurity tool for detecting intrusions in a [[Network]]. It is capable of providing real-time analytics to users regarding the security events of a system. Users can configure it to continually monitor all possible points that might be a source of unauthorized access or entry. These include files, processes, logs, [[Rootkit]]s, and registries. OSSEC is highly beneficial since it can be used on multiple platforms. Examples of such platforms are [[Windows]], [[Linux]], Mac, [[VMWare]] ESX, BSD, among others.
