[[SSL]] certificates are what enable websites to move from [[HTTP]] to [[HTTPS]], which is more secure. An [[SSL]] certificate is a data file hosted in a website's origin server. [[SSL]] [[Certificate]]s make [[SSL]]/[[TLS]] [[Encryption]] possible, and they contain the website's [[Public_Key]] and the website's identity, along with related information.
