A keylogger (or keystroke logger) is a type of software or hardware used to track and record what someone types on their keyboard. [[Keylogger]]s can be used legally (some people even install them on their own devices), and you may have even used a computer with software installed to log keystrokes for monitoring and ensuring safe or approved use.

Keylogging software is a kind of user-made tracking program built to capture keystrokes. Such keystroke loggers, one of the oldest types of a cyber attack, archive the details victim's type into a website or program, then submit it to a third party.
