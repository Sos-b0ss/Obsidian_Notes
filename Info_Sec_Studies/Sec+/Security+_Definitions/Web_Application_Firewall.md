A web application [[Firewall]] is a specific form of application firewall that filters, monitors, and blocks [[HTTP]] traffic to and from a web service.
\
A [[WAF]] or web application firewall helps protect web applications by filtering and monitoring [[HTTP]] traffic between a web application and the [[Internet]]. It typically protects web applications from attacks such as cross-site request forgery([[XSRF]]), cross-site-scripting ([[XSS]]), file inclusion, and [[SQL]] injection, among others.
