\
In Microsoft [[Windows]] applications programming, [[OLE]] Automation is an inter-process communication mechanism created by Microsoft. It is based on a subset of [[Component_Object_Model]] [[COM]] that was intended for use by [[Script]]ing languages – originally Visual Basic ([[VBA]]) – but now is used by several languages on [[Windows]].
\
It provides an infrastructure whereby applications called automation controllers can access and manipulate (i.e. set properties of or call methods on) shared automation [[Object]]s that are exported by other applications. It supersedes Dynamic Data Exchange ([[DDE]]), an older mechanism for applications to control one another.
