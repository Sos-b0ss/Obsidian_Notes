[[RTBH]] routing is a technique that can be used to drop all attack traffic based on either destination or attack source addresses. Source and destination-based [[RTBH]] filter undesirable traffic by forwarding it to the [[Null0_Interface]] (a [[Pseudo_Interface]] that is always up and can never forward or receive traffic).
