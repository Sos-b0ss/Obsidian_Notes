The White Team helps to establish the rules of engagement, the metrics for assessing results and the procedures for providing operational security for the engagement. The White Team normally has responsibility for deriving lessons-learned, conducting the post engagement assessment, and promulgating results.
\
The white team acts as a judge. Every [[Red-Team]] [[Blue-Team]] exercise will have some rules and pre-defined thresholds. The purpose of the white team is to ensure that the rules are enforced and the scope of testing does not exceed the pre-defined threshold. They may also score the teams and resolve if any problem arises.
