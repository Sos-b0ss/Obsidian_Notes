[[GNU]] is an extensive collection of free software, which can be used as an operating system or can be used in parts with other operating systems. The use of the completed [[GNU]] tools led to the family of operating systems popularly known as Linux. Most of [[GNU]] is licensed under the [[GNU]] Project's own General Public License.

[[GNU]] is a Unix-like operating system. That means it is a collection of many programs: applications, libraries, developer tools, even games. The development of [[GNU]], started in January 1984, is known as the [[GNU]] Project. Many of the programs in [[GNU]] are released under the auspices of the [[GNU]] Project; those we call [[GNU]] packages.
