[[ADS]] have been around since the introduction of windows [[NTFS]]. They were designed to provide compatibility with the old Hierarchical File System ([[HFS]]) from Mac which uses something called resource forks. Basically, [[ADS]] can be used to hide the presence of a secret or malicious file inside the file record of an innocent file.
