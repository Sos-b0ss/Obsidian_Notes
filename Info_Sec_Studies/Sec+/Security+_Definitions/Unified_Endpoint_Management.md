[[UEM]] allows [[IT]] to manage, secure, and deploy corporate resources and applications on any device from a single console.
\
[[UEM]] is a class of software tools that provide a single management interface for mobile, PC and other devices. It is an evolution of, and replacement for, mobile device management ([[MDM]]) and enterprise mobility management ([[EMM]]) and client management tools.
\
Unified endpoint management is a step beyond traditional mobile device management. As users increasingly work remotely from traditional as well as mobile devices, and enterprises incorporate [[IoT]] and other new technologies, unified endpoint management has evolved to solve the problems modern IT departments encounter when securing and connecting these environments.
\
[[IT]] departments also face the difficulties of integrating [[Legacy_System]]s on these new devices — leading to higher [[IT]] costs. Unified endpoint management reduces the burden of connecting these systems while lowering costs and mitigating risks.
