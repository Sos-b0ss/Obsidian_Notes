[[CCTV]] is a TV system in which signals are not publicly distributed but are monitored, primarily for surveillance and security purposes. How does [[CCTV]] work? [[CCTV]] relies on strategic placement of cameras, and observation of the camera's input on monitors somewhere.

Closed-circuit television, also known as video surveillance, is the use of video cameras to transmit a signal to a specific place, on a limited set of monitors. It differs from broadcast television in that the signal is not openly transmitted, though it may employ point-to-point [[PPP]], point-to-multipoint, or mesh wired or wireless links.
