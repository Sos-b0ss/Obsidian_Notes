A non-credentialed scan is a scan that does not use credentials to scan assets connected to a network. A non-credential scan only retrieves asset information that is exposed to the network and can thus be collected without logging into the asset. This is basic information like the name of the device or the operating system.

A traditional active non-credentialed scan, also known as an unauthenticated scan, is a common method for assessing the security of systems without system privileges. Non-credentialed scans enumerate a host's exposed ports, protocols, and services and identifies vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that could lead to compromise from an attacker.
