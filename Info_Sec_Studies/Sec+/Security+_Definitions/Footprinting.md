What is Footprinting Refers to the process of collecting as much as information as possible about the target system to find ways to penetrate into the system. An Ethical hacker has to spend the majority of his time in profiling an organization, gathering information about the host, [[Network]] and people related to the organization.
\
Footprinting is an ethical hacking technique used to gather as much data as possible about a specific targeted computer system, an infrastructure and networks to identify opportunities to penetrate them. It is one of the best methods of finding vulnerabilities.
\
Footprinting allows Hackers to gather the basic security configurations of a target machine along with network route and data flow. Once the attacker finds the vulnerabilities he/she focuses on a specific area of the target machine. It allows the hacker to identify as to which attack is handier to hack the target system.
