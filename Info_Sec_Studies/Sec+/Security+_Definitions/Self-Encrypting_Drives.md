A [[SED]] is a type of hard drive that automatically and continuously encrypts the data on the drive without any user interaction.

A self-encrypting drive ([[SED]]) is a hard disk drive ([[HDD]]) or solid-state drive ([[SSD]]) designed to automatically encrypt and decrypt drive data without the need for user input or disk encryption software.
