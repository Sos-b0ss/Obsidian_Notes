A real-time operating system is an operating system for real-time applications that processes data and events that have critically defined time constraints. An [[RTOS]] is distinct from a time sharing operating system, such as [[Unix]], which manages the sharing of system resources with a scheduler, data [[Buffer]]s, or fixed task prioritization in a multitasking or multiprogramming environment
