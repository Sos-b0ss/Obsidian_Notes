Several [[BSS]]s can be joined together to form one logical [[WLAN]] segment, referred to as an extended service set ([[ESS]]). 
\
A Service Set Identifier ([[SSID]]) is simply the 1-32 byte alphanumeric name given to each [[ESS]]. For example, a departmental [[WLAN]] ([[ESS]]) may consist of several access points ([[AP]]s) and dozens of stations, all using the same [[SSID]].
