A [[SWG]] is a security solution that prevents unsecured internet traffic from entering an organization's internal network. It's used by enterprises to protect employees and users from accessing or being infected by malicious websites and web traffic, internet-borne viruses, malware, and other cyberthreats.
\
A secure web gateway is one way to implement this policy, as it can filter out all non-[[HTTPS]] network traffic. [[SWG]]s can perform a number of actions on the web traffic they inspect and forward in order to enforce security policies: 
- URL filtering
- Anti-malware detection and blocking
- Application control
