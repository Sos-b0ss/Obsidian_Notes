A virtual private cloud is an on-demand configurable pool of shared resources allocated within a public cloud environment, providing a certain level of isolation between the different organizations using the resources.
\
A [[VPC]] is a secure, isolated private cloud hosted within a public cloud. [[VPC]] customers can run code, store data, host websites, and do anything else they could do in an ordinary private cloud, but the private [[Cloud]] is hosted remotely by a public cloud provider. (Not all private clouds are hosted in this fashion.)
