Topology Change Notification [[BPDU]]s are used to notify about topology changes in the network. So, if the topology of the network is changed frequently then it will generate a large amount of [[TCN]] [[BPDU]]s in the network which will lead to frequent deletion of [[ARP]] entries and [[MAC]] entries by the devices.
