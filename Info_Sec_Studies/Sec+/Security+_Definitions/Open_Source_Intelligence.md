The first step in a targeted attack - or a penetration test or red team activity - is gathering intelligence on the target. While there are ways and means to do this covertly, intelligence gathering usually starts with scraping information from public sources, collectively known as open source intelligence or [[OSINT]].
\
According to the US Department of Defence, [[OSINT]] is defined as "intelligence that is produced from publicly available information and is collected, exploited, and disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate audience for the purpose of addressing a specific intelligence requirement".
