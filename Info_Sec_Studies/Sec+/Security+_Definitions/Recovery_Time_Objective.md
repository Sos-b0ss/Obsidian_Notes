The recovery time objective ([[RTO]]) is the maximum tolerable length of time that a computer, system, network or application can be down after a failure or disaster occurs. The [[RTO]] is a function of the extent to which the interruption disrupts normal operations and the amount of revenue lost per unit time because of the disaster.

The recovery time objective is the targeted duration of time and a service level within which a business process must be restored after a disaster in order to avoid unacceptable consequences associated with a break in business continuity.
