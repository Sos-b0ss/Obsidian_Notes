A cyber attestation is an independent review and confirmation that an organization’s cybersecurity risk management program meets the standards and requirements set out by a governing body. Since the need for consistent and effective cybersecurity internal controls is necessary for organizations to operate and conduct business, the American Institute of [[CPA]]s ([[AICPA]]) has developed a cyber attestation reporting framework to facilitate the review of the internal controls around an organization’s cybersecurity risk management program. The [[AICPA]]’s cybersecurity attestation is much more than a traditional security [risk assessment process](https://www.auditboard.com/blog/creating-a-successful-risk-assessment-plan/).

Becoming a [[CPA]] gives an accountant higher standing in the eyes of business contacts, professional peers, regulators, and clients alike. This is because a [[CPA]] has met minimum education requirements, passed a rigorous four-part exam, and agreed to abide by a code of ethics.
