Developed in 1993 by [[Bruce_Schneier]], this symmetric algorithm has a 64-bit block size and a variable key size, with the aim of being a drop-in replacement for [[DES]] or [[IDEA]].

The original [[Blowfish]] cipher was designed as an alternative to [[DES]]. It has a 64-bit block size and a variable key size between 32 and 448 bits. It is still widely used today and in some cases is actually faster than [[AES256]] due to the smaller block size of 64-bit blocks versus [[AES]]'s 128-bit blocks.
