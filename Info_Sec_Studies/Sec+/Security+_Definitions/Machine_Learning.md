\
A field of study concerned with the design and development of algorithms and techniques that allow computers to learn.
\
Our computers are getting much smarter and are beginning to be used by attackers to identify patterns in data to improve their predicting capabilities
\
This requires a lot of training data like with Face recognition or smart driving
\
This can however be used to also 
- Stop [[Spam]]
- Recommend products from an online retailer
- prevent car accidents

Poisoning the training data:
\
Used by attackers to confuse the [[AI]] so as to cause the [[AI]] to behave incorrectly
\
Done with a Microsoft [[AI]] chatter bot named [[Tay_AI]] and this made Microsoft turn off [[Tay_AI]] because it turned the bot into a racist and homophobe.
\
[[AI]] will only ever be as good as the training, attackers will always try to find the holes to make it work differently.
