Role-based access control ([[RBAC]]), also known as role-based security, is an access control method that assigns permissions to end-users based on their role within your organization. [[RBAC]] provides fine-grained control, offering a simple, manageable approach to access management that is less error-prone than individually assigning permissions.

In computer systems security, role-based access control or role-based security is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users. It is an approach to implement mandatory access control or discretionary access control. Role-based access control is a policy-neutral access-control mechanism defined around roles and privileges.
