[[BSS]] is a network topology that lets devices communicate through a common medium, like an [[AP]]. The ID is the devices unique identifier, the [[MAC]] address of the [[AP]] being associated with the [[BSS]]. Most often times these are associated with small offices or homes because of the low network range.
