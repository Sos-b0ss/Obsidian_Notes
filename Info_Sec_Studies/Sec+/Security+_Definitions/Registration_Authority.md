A [[RA]] is an authority in a network that verifies user requests for a digital certificate and tells the certificate authority ([[CA]]) to issue it. [[RA]]s are part of a public key infrastructure ([[PKI]]), a networked system that enables companies and users to exchange information and money safely and securely.

Registration authorities exist for many standards organizations, such as [[ANNA]], the [[Object_Management_Group]], [[W3C]], [[IEEE]] and others. In general, registration authorities all perform a similar function, in promoting the use of a particular standard through facilitating its use.
