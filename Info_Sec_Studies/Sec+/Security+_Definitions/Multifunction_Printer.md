A [[MFP]] is an office machine which incorporates the functionality of multiple devices in one, so as to have a smaller footprint in a home or small business setting, or to provide centralized document management/distribution/production in a large-office setting. A typical [[MFP]] may act as a combination of some or all of the following devices: email, fax, photocopier, printer, scanner.
