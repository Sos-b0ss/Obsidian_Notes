Compiled code is when the programming language is optimized and assembled within a program called a compiler and converted into an executable file. Common compiled programming languages are [[C]], [[C++]], [[Visual_Basic]], and [[Pascal]]. Runtime code is code that is evaluated, interpreted, and executed when run, such as [[HTML]].
