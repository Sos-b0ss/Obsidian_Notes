High Availability ([[HA]]) describes systems that are dependable enough to operate continuously without failing. They are well-tested and sometimes equipped with redundant components. "Availability" includes two periods of time: how much time a service is accessible, and how much time the system needs to respond to user requests.

In computing, the term availability is used to describe the period of time when a service is available, as well as the time required by a system to respond to a request made by a user. High availability is a quality of a system or component that assures a high level of operational performance for a given period of time.
