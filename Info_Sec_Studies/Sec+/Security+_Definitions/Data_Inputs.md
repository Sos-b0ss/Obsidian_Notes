[[Cyber_Security_Data_Science]] (CSDS) is a rapidly emerging profession focused on applying **data** science to prevent, detect, and remediate expanding and evolving cybersecurity threats. [[CSDS]] is increasingly formally recognized as a cybersecurity job specialty, for instance in the [[NIST]] [[NICE]] Cybersecurity Workforce [[Framework]].
