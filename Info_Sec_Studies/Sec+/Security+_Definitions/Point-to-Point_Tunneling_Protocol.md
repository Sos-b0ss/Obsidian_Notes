The Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol is an obsolete method for implementing virtual private networks. [[PPTP]] has many well known security issues. [[PPTP]] uses a [[TCP]] control channel and a Generic Routing Encapsulation tunnel to encapsulate [[PPP]] packets. Many modern [[VPN]]s use various forms of [[UDP]] for this same functionality.
