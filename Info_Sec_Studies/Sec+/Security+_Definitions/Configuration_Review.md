Cybersecurity experts like us can use configuration reviews to ensure that all the security features in your software and appliances are enabled and correctly configured. Working on your behalf as an extension of your team, we can update and reconfigure whatever's necessary to keep you and your customers' data safe.
\
Our configuration review methodology entails having formal discussions and interviews with your [[IT]] teams to understand their requirements and challenges. We then proceed toward gathering information and data on the current configuration settings of your [[IT]] systems. The data gathering phase is carried out using automated scripts or manually.
