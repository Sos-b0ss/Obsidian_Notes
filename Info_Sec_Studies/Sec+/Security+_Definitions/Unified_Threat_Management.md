[[UTM]] is an approach to information security where a single hardware or software installation provides multiple security functions. This contrasts with the traditional method of having point solutions for each security function. [[UTM]] simplifies information-security management by providing a single management and reporting point for the security administrator rather than managing multiple products from different vendors.
