Privilege escalation is the act of exploiting a bug, design flaw or configuration oversight in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user.
\
Privilege escalation attacks are a prevalent and complex threat, and any [[Network]] can become a target. Organizations need multiple defense strategies when any asset can become an entry point for intruders. Understanding the privilege escalation process is an important first step toward prevention and defense against extensive [[Network]] attacks.
