Next-Gen [[SWG]]s use a variety of security techniques, including but not limited to: application control, user and entity behavior analytics ([[Info_Sec_Studies/Acronyms/UEBA]]), and machine learning ([[ML]]) to protect against threats. A next-generation [[SWG]] will also provide you with visibility into all of the traffic passing through your network, including encrypted traffic. This is important because it allows you to see what applications and sites are being accessed, as well as potential threats that may be lurking in your network.
