Input Handling is the term used to describe functions such as validation, sanitization, filtering, or encoding and/or decoding of input data. Improper Input Handling is a leading cause of critical vulnerabilities that exist in today's systems and applications.
\
Unchecked input is the root cause of some of today's worst and most common software security problems. Cross-site scripting ([[XSS]]), SQL injection ([[SQLi]]), and process control vulnerabilities all stem from incomplete or absent input validation.
