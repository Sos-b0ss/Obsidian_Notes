Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol is a proprietary wireless [[LAN]] authentication method developed by Cisco Systems. Important features of [[LEAP]] are dynamic [[WEP]] keys and mutual authentication. [[LEAP]] allows for clients to re-authenticate frequently; upon each successful authentication, the clients acquire a new [[WEP]] key.
