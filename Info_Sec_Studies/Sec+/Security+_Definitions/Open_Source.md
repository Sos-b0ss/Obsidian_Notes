Generally, open source refers to a computer program in which the source code is available to the general public for use or modification from its original design. Code is released under the terms of a software license. Depending on the license terms, others may then download, modify, and publish their version (fork) back to the community.

Open-source software is computer software that allows anyone to use, study, change and distribute it for any purpose. It is often very collaborative with community members releasing **open-source** iterations with improved features or fixed bugs.
