An audit trail is another name for log files stored in [[Event_Viewer]]. These logs help the administrator identify malicious access attempts. [[Brute_Force]] access attempts would be clearly logged in [[Event_Viewer]], making them easier to resolve, but it is difficult to determine the perpetrator unless logging is performed at the [[Firewall]]/router levels.
