The Data Encryption Standard is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of digital data. Although its short key length of 56 bits makes it too insecure for applications, it has been highly influential in the advancement of cryptography.
\
The Data Encryption Standard is a [[Block_Cypher]], meaning a cryptographic key and algorithm are applied to a block of data simultaneously rather than one bit at a time. To encrypt a [[Plaintext]] message, [[DES]] groups it into 64-bit blocks. Each block is enciphered using the secret key into a 64-bit ciphertext by means of permutation and substitution.
