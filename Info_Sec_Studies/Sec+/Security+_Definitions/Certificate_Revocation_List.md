In cryptography, a certificate revocation list is "a list of digital [[Certificate]]s that have been revoked by the issuing certificate authority before their scheduled expiration date and should no longer be trusted". [[CRL]]s are no longer required by the [[CA]]/[[Browser]] forum, as alternate [[Certificate]] revocation technologies are increasingly used instead. Nevertheless, [[CRL]]s are still widely used by the [[CA]]s.
