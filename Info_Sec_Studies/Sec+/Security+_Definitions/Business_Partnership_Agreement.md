\
A partnership agreement is a legal document that dictates how a small for-profit business will operate under two or more people.
\
The agreement lays out the responsibilities of each partner in the business, how much of the business each partner owns, and how much profit and loss each partner is responsible for. It also includes rules about how you’ll manage the business and addresses potential scenarios that could affect the business, such as death of a partner or how a partner can leave the company.
\
The purpose of a partnership agreement is to get in writing answers to common questions that could arise in the business, so you and your partner(s) don’t find yourselves at odds down the line.
