Penetration testing, also called pen testing ([[Pentest]]), is a cyberattack simulation launched on your computer system. The simulation helps discover points of exploitation and test [[IT]] breach security. By doing consistent pen testing businesses can obtain expert, unbiased third-party feedback on their security processes.
\
In a known environment this means that you are searching for vulnerabilities in services and systems that you already know exist and what their functions are for, as if you were accomplishing the attack with insider knowledge. This type of test is important because in a penetration test that you go into blind you may not actually be discovering the full breadth of the attack surface and missing other crucial [[Attack_Vector]]s that a [[Threat_Actor]] may try and use.
