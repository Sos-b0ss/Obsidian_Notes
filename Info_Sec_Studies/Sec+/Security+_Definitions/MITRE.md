Though many believe [[MITRE]] is an acronym that stands for, "Massachusetts Institute of Technology Research & Engineering", it is actually just the name of a company.
\
The [[Mitre]] Corporation is an American not-for-profit organization with dual headquarters in Bedford, Massachusetts, and McLean, Virginia. It manages federally funded research and development centers supporting various U.S. government agencies in the aviation, defense, healthcare, homeland security, and cybersecurity fields, among others.
\
[[MITRE]] worked on [[Neural_Network]] software, the long-distance telecommunications service [[FTS2000]] for the [[General_Services_Administration]], and a new computer system for the [[US_Securities_and_Exchange_Commission]] On January 29, 1996.
\
Mitre divided into two entities: The [[MITRE]] Corporation, to focus on its [[FFRDC]]s ("Federally funded research and development centers") for DoD and FAA; and a new company established in McLean, called [[Mitretek_Systems]] until 2007 and now called [[Noblis]], to assume non-[[FFRDC]] research work for other U.S. Government agencies.
