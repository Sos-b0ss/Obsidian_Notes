Typosquatting is a method hackers use to trick you. Attackers can use typosquatting to trick you into visiting a website (so they earn ad revenue at best or steal your data at worst), install [[Malware]] onto your computer, or combine it with a [[Phishing]] email. Typosquatting is part of a bigger cybercrime category called cybersquatting.
