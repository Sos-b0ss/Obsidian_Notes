Address space layout randomization is a computer security technique involved in preventing exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities. In order to prevent an attacker from reliably jumping to, for example, a particular exploited function in memory, [[ASLR]] randomly arranges the address space positions of key data areas of a process, including the base of the executable and the positions of the stack, heap and libraries.
