A system on a chip is an integrated circuit [[IC]] that combines many elements of a computer system into a single chip. An [[SoC]] always includes a [[CPU]], but it might also include system memory, [[Peripheral]] controllers (for [[USB]], storage), and more advanced peripherals such as graphics processing units ([[GPU]]s), specialized neural network circuitry, radio modems (for [[Bluetooth]] or [[Wi-Fi]]), and more.
