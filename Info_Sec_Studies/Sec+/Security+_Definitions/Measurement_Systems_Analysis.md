[[MSA]] is a tool for analyzing the variation present in each type of inspection, measurement, and test equipment. It is the system to assess the quality of the measurement system. In other words, it allows us to make sure that the variation in our measurement is minimal compared to the variation in our process.

A measurement systems analysis is a thorough assessment of a measurement process, and typically includes a specially designed experiment that seeks to identify the components of variation in that measurement process.
