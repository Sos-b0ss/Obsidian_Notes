[[SNMP]] is an internet standard protocol for collecting and organizing information about managed devices on IP networks and for modifying that information to change device behavior.
\
[[SNMP]] version 1 and 2 are available, but they are considered insecure. SNMP should be upgraded to version 3 for security and sending data across the network. SNMP v1 and v2 may be abused in order to gain unauthorized access to network devices. They both used simple/clear text passwords in their communications, but [[SNMP]] v3 closes that vulnerability with encoded parameters.
\
The standard form of [[SNP]] is the Simple Network Management Protocol. It is used for managing network devices locally or remotely.
