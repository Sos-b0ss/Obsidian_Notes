Gain higher-level access to a system by exploiting a vulnerability from a lower access user.
- Higher level access meaning greater control over the system

These are high vulnerability patches
\
Sometimes there is Horizontal Privilege escalation making it so that user A can access user Bs resources even though they are both the same level of access to the machine.
\
Its very common that updated anti-virus/anti-malware software will block privilege escalation attempts from occurring.
\
Sometimes the [[OS]] may also have safeguards in place to prevent the attacker from taking advantage of this.
\
An example of this [[OS]] safeguard is:
[[Data_Execution_Prevention]]
\
An example of this was:
[[CVE-2020-1530]]
