[[SMTPS]] is a method for securing the [[SMTP]] using transport layer security. It is intended to provide [[Authentication]] of the communication partners, as well as data [[Integrity]] and [[Confidentiality]]. [[SMTPS]] is not a proprietary protocol and not an extension of [[SMTP]]. It is a way to secure [[SMTP]] at the transport layer, by wrapping [[SMTP]] inside [[TLS]].
