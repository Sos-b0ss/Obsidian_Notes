Race condition occurs when multiple [[CPU]] [[Threads]] read and write the same variable i.e. they have access to some shared data and they try to change it at the same time. In such a scenario threads are "racing" each other to access/change the data.
\
Race condition attacks (also called [[Time_of_Check_to_Time_of_Use]], or [[TOCTTOU]] attacks) take advantage of the need that computing systems must execute some tasks in a specific sequence. In any such sequence, there is a small period of time when the system has carried out the first task but not started on the second.
\
A race condition is an undesirable situation that occurs when a device or system attempts to perform two or more operations at the same time, but because of the nature of the device or system, the operations must be done in the proper sequence to be done correctly. Race conditions are most commonly associated with computer science and programming.
