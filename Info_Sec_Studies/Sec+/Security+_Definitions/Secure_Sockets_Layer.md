[[SSL]], or Secure Sockets Layer, is an encryption -based Internet security protocol. It was first developed by Netscape in 1995 for the purpose of ensuring privacy, authentication, and data integrity in [[Internet]] communications. [[SSL]] is the predecessor to the modern [[TLS]] encryption used today.
\
Secure Socket Layer ([[SSL]]) provides security to the data that is transferred between web browser and server. [[SSL]] encrypts the link between a web server and a browser which ensures that all data passed between them remain private and free from attack.
