An intrusion prevention system ([[IPS]]) - sometimes referred to as an intrusion detection prevention system ([[IDPS]]) - is a network security technology and key part of any enterprise security system that continuously monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and takes steps to prevent it.
\
Intrusion prevention systems are placed in-line and are able to actively prevent or block intrusions that are detected. [[IPS]] can take such actions as sending an alarm, dropping detected malicious [[Packets]], resetting a connection or blocking traffic from the offending [[IP]] address.
