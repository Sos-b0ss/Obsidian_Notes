In computing, chaining is a technique used in computer architecture in which scalar and vector registers generate interim results which can be used immediately, without additional memory references which reduce computational speed. The chaining technique was first used by Seymour Cray in the 80 MHz Cray 1 supercomputer in 1976.

In cryptography, an initialization vector or starting variable is an input to a cryptographic primitive being used to provide the initial state. The [[IV]] is typically required to be random or pseudorandom, but sometimes an IV only needs to be unpredictable or unique.
