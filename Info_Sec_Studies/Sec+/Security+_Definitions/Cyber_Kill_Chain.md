The Cyber Kill Chain is a series of steps that outline and trace the stages of a cyber attack. Security experts use this model to assist in understanding how threat actors perform their attacks. The steps include:
\
1. [[Active_Reconnaissance]]/[[Passive_Reconnaissance]]
2. [[Weaponization]]
3. [[Delivery]]
4. [[Exploitation]]
5. [[Installation]]
6. [[Command_and_Control]] ([[C2]])
7. [[Actions_on_Objectives]]
\
Reporting is NOT one of these steps.
