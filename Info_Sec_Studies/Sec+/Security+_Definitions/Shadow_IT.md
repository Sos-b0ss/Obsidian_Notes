In big organizations, shadow [[IT]] refers to "Information technology") ([[IT]]) systems deployed by departments other than the central [[IT]] department, to work around the perceived or actual shortcomings of the central information systems. Shadow [[IT]] often introduces security and compliance concerns.
\
Besides security risks, some of the implications of Shadow [[IT]] are:

-   **Wasted time** Shadow [[IT]] adds hidden costs to organizations, consisting largely of non-[[IT]] workers in finance, marketing, HR, etc., who spend a significant amount of time discussing and re-checking the validity of certain data, setting up and managing systems and software without experience.
-   **Inconsistent business logic** If a ‘shadow [[IT]]’ spreadsheet application encapsulates its own definitions and calculations, it is likely that over time inconsistencies will arise from the accumulation of small differences from one version to another and from one group to another, as spreadsheets are often copied and modified. In addition, many errors that occur from either lack of understanding of the concepts or incorrect use of the spreadsheet frequently go undetected due to a lack of rigorous testing and version control.
-   **Inconsistent approach** Even when the definitions and formulas are correct, the methodology for doing analysis can be distorted by the arrangement and flow of linked spreadsheets, or the process itself can be wrong.
-   **Wasted investment** Shadow [[IT]] applications sometimes prevent full [Return on investment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment "Return on investment") ([[ROI]]) from investments in systems that are designed to perform the functions now replaced by Shadow [[IT]]. This is often seen in [[Data_Warehousing]] ([[DW]]) and [[Business_Informatics]] ([[BI]]) projects, which are initiated with good intentions, where the broader and consistent usage of [[DW]] and [[BI]] in the organization never really starts off. This can also be caused by management failure to anticipate deployment, licensing and system capacity costs when attempting to deliver [[DW]] & [[BI]] solutions. Adopting an internal cost model that forces potential new users of the DW/BI system to choose cheaper (shadow) alternatives, also plays a part in preventing successful enterprise implementation.
-   **Inefficiencies** Shadow IT can be a barrier to innovation by blocking the establishment of more efficient work processes. Additional performance bottlenecks and new single points of failure may be introduced when Shadow IT systems layer on top of existing systems. Data might be exported from a shared system to a spreadsheet to perform the critical tasks or analysis.
-   **Higher risk of data loss or leaks** Shadow IT data backup procedures may not be provided or audited. Personnel and contractors in Shadow IT operations may not be put through normal education, procedures or vetting processes. Originators of Shadow IT systems may leave the organization often leaving with proprietary data or leaving behind complicated systems the remainder of staff cannot manage.
-   **Barrier to enhancement** Shadow IT can act as a brake on the adoption of new technology. Because IT artifacts, e.g., spreadsheets, are deployed to fill critical needs, they must be replaced carefully. But lacking adequate documentation, controls and standards, that process is slow and error-prone.
-   **Organizational dysfunction** Shadow IT creates a dysfunctional environment leading to animosity between IT and non-IT related groups within an organization. Improper motivations behind Shadow IT efforts such as seeking job-security (i.e., "Bob is the only person with this data," or "What will happen if he leaves?"), data hoarding, self-promotion, favor trading, etc. can lead to significant management issues.
-   **Compliance issues** Shadow IT increases the likelihood of uncontrolled data flows, making it more difficult to comply with the [Sarbanes-Oxley Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes-Oxley_Act "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") (US) and many other compliance-centric initiatives, such as: [Basel II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_II "Basel II") (International Standards for Banking), GLBA ([Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramm-Leach-Bliley_Act "Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act")),[[7]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_IT#cite_note-7) COBIT ([Control Objectives for Information and related Technology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_Objectives_for_Information_and_related_Technology "Control Objectives for Information and related Technology")), FISMA ([Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Security_Management_Act_of_2002 "Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002")), DFARS ([Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Federal_Acquisition_Regulation_Supplement "Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement")), GAAP ([Generally Accepted Accounting Principles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generally_Accepted_Accounting_Principles "Generally Accepted Accounting Principles")), HIPAA ([Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act "Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act")), IFRS ([International Financial Reporting Standards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Financial_Reporting_Standards "International Financial Reporting Standards")), ITIL ([Information Technology Infrastructure Library](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology_Infrastructure_Library "Information Technology Infrastructure Library")), PCI DSS ([Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard "Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard")), GDPR ([General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation "General Data Protection Regulation")),[[8]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_IT#cite_note-8) CCPA ([California Consumer Privacy Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act "California Consumer Privacy Act")), NYDFS (New York Department of Financial Services)
