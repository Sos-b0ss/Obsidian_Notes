In computer networking, a wireless access point, or more generally just access point, is a networking hardware device that allows other [[Wi-Fi]] devices to connect to a wired network. As a standalone device, the [[AP]] may have a wired connection to a router, but, in a wireless router, it can also be an integral component of the router itself. An [[AP]] is differentiated from a hotspot which is a physical location where [[Wi-Fi]] access is available.
