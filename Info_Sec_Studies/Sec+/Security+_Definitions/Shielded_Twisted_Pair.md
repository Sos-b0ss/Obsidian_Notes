[[STP]] is a special kind of copper telephone and local area network ([[LAN]]) wiring used in some business installations. It adds an outer covering or shield that functions as a ground to ordinary twisted pair wiring. Twisted pair is the ordinary copper wire that connects many computer networks to the telephone company.

Twisted pair cabling is a type of wiring in which two conductors of a single circuit are twisted together for the purposes of improving electromagnetic compatibility. Compared to a single conductor or an untwisted balanced pair, a twisted pair reduces electromagnetic radiation from the pair and crosstalk between neighboring pairs and improves rejection of external electromagnetic interference.
