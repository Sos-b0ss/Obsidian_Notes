\
When an attacker performs active reconnaissance, they directly engage a target computer or network in order to gather data. This is typically the second preparatory step of a cyber-attack, and the purpose of performing active reconnaissance is to potentially expose ways the attacker could gain access to a system.

Attacker builds a believable pretext
- Where you work
- Where you bank
- Recent financial transactions
- Family and friends

The Pretext
- Before the attack the trap is set (there's and actor and a story)

Attackers pretend to be someone they aren't
\
Use some of those details from reconnaissance
\
Attack the victim as someone higher in rank
\
Throw tons of technical details around
\
Act like a buddy to disarm you and probe for information
