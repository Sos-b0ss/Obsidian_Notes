A cybersecurity contingency plan is a written risk management document that provides instructions, recommendations, and considerations for a company on how to recover their [[IT]] services and data in the event of a security breach, disaster, or system disruption.
\
A cybersecurity contingency plan's primary objective is to protect data and assets after a security breach or disaster has occurred. This type of plan will include steps on protective measures, on ways to prevent future attacks, breaches, or loss. It will also include approaches on how to collect and preserve evidence and how to develop a root cause analysis.
\
A cybersecurity [[CP]] consists of three different plans combined: 
- Disaster recovery plan
- Emergency mode operation plan
- Data backup plan.
\
A disaster recovery plan is defined as a set of written procedures for recovery and protection after a major event has occurred. In the information technology field, this plan is focused on restoring operations of a company's systems and applications at an alternate site designated for use after an emergency.
\
The emergency mode operations plan is also known as a business continuity plan. The main focus of this plan is to list guidelines and procedures on sustaining normal business operations during and after a disaster or interruption to the systems. An emergency mode operations plan can include specific or all systems and operations that require support. This plan will usually only have short-term plans for business continuity processes and not long-term continuity and recovery processes.
