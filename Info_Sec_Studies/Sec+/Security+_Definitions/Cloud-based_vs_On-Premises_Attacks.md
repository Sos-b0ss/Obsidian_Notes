Two categories for [[IT]] security:
- The on-premises data is more secure!
- The cloud-based data is more secure!

[[Cloud]]-based security is centralized and costs less:
- No dedicated hardware, no data center to secure and costs less
- A third-party handles everything

On-premises puts the security burden on the client:
- [[Data_Center]] security and infrastructure costs
