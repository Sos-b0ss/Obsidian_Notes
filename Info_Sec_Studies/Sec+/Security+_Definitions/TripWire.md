A file and directory integrity checker. Tripwire is a tool that aids system administrators and users in monitoring a designated set of files for any changes. Used with system files on a regular (e.g., daily) basis, [[Tripwire]] can notify system administrators of corrupted or tampered files, so damage control measures can be taken in a timely manner. Traditionally an open source tool, [[Tripwire]] Corp is now focused on their commercial enterprise configuration control offerings. An [[Open_Source]] [[Linux]] version can still be found at [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/tripwire/). [[Unix]] users may also want to consider [[Advanced_Intrusion_Detection_Environment]], which has been designed to be a free [[Tripwire]] replacement.
