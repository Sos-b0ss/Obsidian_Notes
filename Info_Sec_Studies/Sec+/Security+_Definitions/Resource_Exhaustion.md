Resource exhaustion attacks are computer security exploits that crash, hang, or otherwise interfere with the targeted program or system.

They are a form of denial-of-service attack but are different from distributed denial-of-service ([[DOS]]) attacks, which involve overwhelming a [[Network]] host such as a web [[Server]] with Requests from many locations.
