### The Four-way Handshake or TCP Connection Termination:

Here, to terminate an established [[TCP]] connection, the following 4 [[TCP]] [[Packets]] are needed to be exchanged. Which you can understand with the statements below:

**1.** Host A → Host B: FIN flag set.  
**2.** Host B → Host A: ACK flag set.  
**3.** Host B → Host A: FIN flag set.  
**4.** Host A → Host B: ACK flag set.
