A [[CSU]]/[[DSU]] is a hardware device about the size of an external modem that converts a digital data frame from the communications technology used on a local area network ([[LAN]]) into a frame appropriate to a wide-area network ([[WAN]]) and vice versa.
\
In telecommunications, a channel service unit is a line Bridging device for use with [[T-carrier]] that: 
	• is used to perform loopback testing, 
	• may perform bit stuffing, 
	• may also provide a framing and formatting pattern compatible with the network, 
	• provides a barrier for electrical interference from either side of the unit, and 
	• is the last signal regeneration point, on the loop side, coming from the central office, before the regenerated signal reaches a multiplexer or data terminal equipment.
