Trivial File Transfer Protocol is a simple lockstep File Transfer Protocol which allows a client to get a file from or put a file onto a remote host. One of its primary uses is in the early stages of nodes booting from a local area network. [[TFTP]] has been used for this application because it is very simple to implement. [[TFTP]] was first standardized in 1981 and the current specification for the protocol can be found in [[RFC]] 1350.
