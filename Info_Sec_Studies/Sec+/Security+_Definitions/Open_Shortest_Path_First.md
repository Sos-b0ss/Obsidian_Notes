Open Shortest Path First is a routing protocol for [[IP]] [[Network]]s. It uses a link state routing algorithm and falls into the group of interior gateway protocols, operating within a single autonomous system. [[OSPF]] gathers link state information from available routers and constructs a [[Network_Topology]] map.
