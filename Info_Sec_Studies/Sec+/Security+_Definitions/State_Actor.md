Nation state threat actors are very much mission focused, they don't care how long they have to research, scan and probe their target. It may take weeks, months or even in some cases years to achieve their objective. They are very persistent. They are working within the legal guidelines of their own country.

This new paradigm of individual and knowledge-centered cyberpower means state actors no longer fully monopolize violence, per Max Weber's definition of a state. Furthermore, unlike the interstate dynamic between nuclear powers, cyber warfare is offense-dominant due to the absence of efficient deterrence.
