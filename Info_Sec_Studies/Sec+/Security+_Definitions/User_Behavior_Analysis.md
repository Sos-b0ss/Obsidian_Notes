[[UEBA]] or [[UBA]] User behavior analytics logs all user activity. It will log when a user requests access to files, when those files were accessed, by whom, how often, and even log what was done with that data. [[UEBA]] also logs when users launch apps, which [[Network]]s they access, and what they do when they are on them.

User and entity behavior analytics ([[UEBA]]), or user behavior analytics ([[UBA]]), is a type of cybersecurity solution or feature that discovers threats by identifying activity that deviates from a normal baseline.
