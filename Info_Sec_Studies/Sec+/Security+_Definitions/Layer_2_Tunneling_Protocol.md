In computer networking, [[L2TP]] is a tunneling protocol used to support virtual private networks or as part of the delivery of services by [[ISP]]s. It uses encryption only for its own control messages, and does not provide any encryption or confidentiality of content by itself. Rather, it provides a tunnel for Layer 2, and the tunnel itself may be passed over a Layer 3 encryption protocol such as [[IPsec]].
