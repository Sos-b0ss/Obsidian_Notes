\
In general terms, a [[MITM]] attack works by exploiting vulnerabilities in [[Network]], web, or browser-based security protocols to divert legitimate traffic and steal information from victims. Because [[VPN]]s encrypt data traveling between devices on the network they're able to help protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.
\
The interception phase is essentially how the attacker inserts themselves as the man in the middle." Attackers frequently do this by creating a fake [[Wi-Fi]] hotspot in a public space that doesn't require a password. If a victim connects to the hotspot, the attacker gains access to any online data exchanges they perform.
\
[[MITM]] attack is a general term for when a perpetrator positions himself in a conversation between a user and an application—either to eavesdrop or to impersonate one of the parties, making it appear as if a normal exchange of information is underway.
