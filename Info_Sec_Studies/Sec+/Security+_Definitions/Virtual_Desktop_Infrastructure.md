\
Virtual desktop infrastructure, often shortened to just [[VDI]], is [[IT]] infrastructure that lets you access enterprise computer systems from almost any device (such as your personal computer, smartphone, or tablet), eliminating the need for your company to provide you with—and manage, repair, and replace—a physical machine.
\
[[VDI]] is the creation and management of desktop environments and applications that allow employees to work and access applications and services outside the office, in the office, or from a remote location.
