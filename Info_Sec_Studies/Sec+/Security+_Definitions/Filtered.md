When a port is appearing as filtered when conducting a scan of the open ports on a machine or network then that likely means that the port is being managed by a [[Firewall]]. It could mean that the port is open but only on specific circumstances however it most commonly will be because of a [[Firewall]] managing the traffic flow to and from those [[Ports]].
