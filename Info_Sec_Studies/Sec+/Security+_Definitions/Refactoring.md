Refactoring is the process of restructuring code, while not changing its original functionality. The goal of refactoring is to improve internal code by making many small changes without altering the code's external behavior. Computer programmers and software developers refactor code to improve the design, structure and implementation of software.

Refactoring can also apply to a type of code added to [[Malware]] by malware authors that is used to make [[Malware]] metamorphic and more difficult to contain and prevent future infections.

It does this to make itself look like a different program every time its downloaded, and it is done by adding what's called a [[NOP]] instruction or [[No_operation]] instruction. It also adds various pointless loops and code [[String]]s.
