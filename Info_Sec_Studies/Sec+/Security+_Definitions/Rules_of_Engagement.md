The Rules of Engagement provides information on how the tester will communicate with the businesses team. Its important that any penetration testers will always reach out before testing, to ensure that the businesses team is aware he or she will be actively engaging the systems. Additionally, if there are any high or critical vulnerabilities, you should notify the business immediately.
\
Essentially, [[Rules_of_Engagement]] ([[RoE]]) are meant to list the details of the penetration test. That's the details behind what exactly will be tested when it will be tested, how it will be tested, and who the primary contacts will be throughout the engagement.
\
These Rules of Engagement are designed to allow you to effectively evaluate the security of your assets while preventing harm to other customers or the infrastructure itself. All penetration tests must follow the Microsoft [[Cloud]] Penetration Testing Rules of Engagement as detailed on this page.
