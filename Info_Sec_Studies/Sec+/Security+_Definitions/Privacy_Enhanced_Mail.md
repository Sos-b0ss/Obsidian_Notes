Privacy-Enhanced Mail is a de facto file format for storing and sending cryptographic keys, certificates, and other data, based on a set of 1993 [[IETF]] standards defining "privacy-enhanced mail." While the original standards were never broadly adopted and were supplanted by [[PGP]] and [[SMIME]], the textual encoding they defined became very popular. The [[PEM]] format was eventually formalized by the [[IETF]] in RFC 7468.
