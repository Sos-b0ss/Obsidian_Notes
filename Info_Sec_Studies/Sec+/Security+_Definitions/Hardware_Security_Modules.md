https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module
A hardware security module is a physical computing device that safeguards and manages digital keys, performs encryption and decryption functions for digital signatures, strong authentication and other cryptographic functions.
\
Hardware security modules ([[HSM]]s) are used for encryption during secure login and authentication processes. They are also used for digital signing of data and payment security systems. [[HSM]]s are preferred when performance is a priority. They are faster than software encryption systems. One main way to distinguish and [[HSM]] from a Trusted Platform Module ([[TPM]]), which can perform similar duties, is that an [[HSM]] is an external or additional device added to the system.
