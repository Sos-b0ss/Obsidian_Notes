In distributed computing, a remote procedure call [[RPC]] is when a computer program causes a procedure subroutine to execute in a different address space (commonly on another computer on a shared [[Network]]), which is coded as if it were a normal (local) procedure call, without the programmer explicitly coding the details for the remote interaction. That is, the programmer writes essentially the same code whether the subroutine is local to the executing program, or remote.
