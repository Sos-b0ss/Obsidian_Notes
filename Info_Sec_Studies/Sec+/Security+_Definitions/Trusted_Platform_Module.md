Trusted Platform Module is an international standard for a secure cryptoprocessor, a dedicated microcontroller designed to secure hardware through integrated cryptographic keys. The term can also refer to a chip conforming to the standard.

A [[TPM]], or a trusted platform module, is a physical or embedded security technology (microcontroller) that resides on a computer's motherboard or in its [[CPU]]. [[TPM]]s use cryptography to help securely store essential and critical information on PCs to enable platform authentication.
