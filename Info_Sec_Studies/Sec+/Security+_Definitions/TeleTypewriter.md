A [[TTY]] is a communication device used by people who are deaf, hard-of-hearing, or have severe speech impairment. People who don't have a [[TTY]] can communicate with a [[TTY]] user through a [[Message_Relay_Center]] ([[MRC]]). An [[MRC]] has [[TTY]] operators available to send and interpret [[TTY]] messages.
