A logic bomb is a malicious piece of code that's secretly inserted into a computer [[Network]], operating system ([[OS]]), or software application. It lies dormant until a specific condition occurs. When this condition is met, the logic bomb is triggered — devastating a system by corrupting data, deleting files, or clearing hard drives.

A malicious piece of code is secretly inserted into a computer's or [[Network]]'s existing software. It may also be inserted into other forms of malware such as [[Virus]]es, [[Worms]] or [[Trojan]] horses. A logic bomb is sneaky because its code lies dormant until the trigger occurs.
