Wardriving involves attackers searching for wireless ([[Wi-FI]]) [[Network]]s with vulnerabilities while moving around an area in a moving vehicle. They use hardware and software to discover unsecured [[Wi-Fi]] [[Network]]s then gain unauthorized access to the [[Network]] by cracking passwords or decrypting the router.
