A [[Hash_Collision]] is an event that appears when he hashing algorithm ends up creating a [[Hash]] value that is the same for different passwords. This can permit an attacker access despite not having the correct password. [[Birthday_Attack]]s can be mitigated by increasing the [[Hash_Bit_Length]], which increases the number of hashes that can be generated.
