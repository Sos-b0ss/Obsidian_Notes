An [[IV]] is an arbitrary number that can be used along with a secret key for data encryption. This number, also called a [[Nonce]], is employed only one time in any session. The use of an [[IV]] prevents repetition in data encryption, making it more difficult for a hacker using a dictionary attack to find patterns and break a [[Cypher]].
\
[[IV]] is a block of bits that are required to allow a [[Stream_Cypher]] or a [[Block_Cypher]] to be executed in any of several modes of operation to produce a unique stream independent from other streams produced by the same encryption key, without having to go through a (usually lengthy) re-keying process.
