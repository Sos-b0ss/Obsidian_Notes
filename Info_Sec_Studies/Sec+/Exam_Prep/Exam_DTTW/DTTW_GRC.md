# Q1:
You are currently developing a set of detailed instructions that explain how to effectively and securely create a new user account.

What is being developed here?

What did I answer?:
**AUP**

Correct answer: **SOP**

A standard operating procedure (SOP) is a set of step-by-step instructions that employees are to follow when performing a specific task, such as account creation. SOPs are helpful to support security policies as well.

An acceptable use policy (AUP) outlines how employees are expected to act when using a company's system or network. A business partner agreement (BPA) is a written agreement between two business partners that specifies each partner's obligations. A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) is a document stating that an entity will not share proprietary data outside of the organization.

# Q2:
An organization wants to ensure that its employees understand how they are expected to behave while using company information systems.

Which of the following should outline this information for employees?

What did I answer?:
**MOA**

Correct answer: **AUP**

An acceptable use policy (AUP) outlines the rules and behaviors expected of those using company systems or networks. For example, an acceptable use policy might state that employees cannot download personal applications onto their corporate-owned computer.

An interconnection security agreement (ISA) is an agreement between organizations planning to operate interconnected IT systems. A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) states that an individual will not share confidential and proprietary data but doesn't outline how they should behave while using company systems. A memorandum of agreement (MOA) constitutes a legal agreement between two parties that wish to work together.

# Q3:
Two organizations are planning to develop a connection between their organizations.

Which of the following outlines the technical details for planning, establishing, maintaining, and disconnecting a secure connection between two entities?

What did I answer:
**BPA**

Correct answer: **ISA**

An interconnection security agreement (ISA) is a type of agreement between multiple entities that outlines the technical requirements for planning, establishing, maintaining, and disconnecting a secure connection between those entities.

A service level agreement (SLA) is a type of agreement between a vendor and client that outlines the expectations for the vendor to meet. A business partner agreement (BPA) is a type of agreement between business partners that outlines each partner's obligations. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) is an understanding between two or more parties that states their intention to work toward a specific goal.

# Q4:
An organization has just implemented mandatory vacations.

What is the likely reason for this?

What did I answer?:
**To prevent employee burnout**

Correct answer: To detect employees involved in malicious activities

Mandatory vacation policies can help detect if an employee is involved in malicious activities such as embezzlement or fraud. This is because employees involved in these activities will need to be present to hide their activities constantly. If another individual takes their responsibilities while they are out on a mandatory vacation, any nefarious activities will likely be uncovered.

# Q5:
An organization evaluated its risk of financial loss due to a flood occurring and affecting their office building. The organization's executives determined that they would purchase flood insurance to cover the financial losses resulting from a flood.

What is this an example of?

What did I answer?:
**Risk acceptance**

Correct answer: **Risk transfer**

There are several different risk responses that an organization can make when faced with a potential risk. Risk transfer refers to the organization transferring the risk (either entirely or partially) to another entity. This is often done by purchasing insurance, such as in this scenario, but can also be achieved through outsourcing.

Other risk responses include risk avoidance, risk mitigation, and risk acceptance.

You are performing a quantitative risk assessment and need to find the annualized loss expectancy for a specific risk.

Which of the following calculations can be used to find the annualized loss expectancy?

Correct answer: SLE x ARO = ALE

As a way to determine the annualized loss expectancy (ALE) related to a specific incident or risk, you should multiply the single loss expectancy (SLE) and the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO). The single loss expectancy (SLE) refers to the loss of value in dollars for a single incident. The annualized rate of occurrence (ARO) is the number of times that a particular incident will occur.
