\
14% of the CompTIA SEC+ exam exam:
\
With this domain, candidates are asked about all-important policies, plans and procedures related to organizational security, including standard operating procedures, different types of agreements (such as service level agreement, or [[SLA]]), and personnel management controls such as job rotation, mandatory vacations, segregation of duties, background checks and awareness training based on the user’s role.
\
Testers need to be able to summarize business impact analysis concepts such as recovery point objective ([[RPO]]) and recovery time objective ([[RTO]]), the mean time between failures ([[MTBF]]) and mean time to repair ([[MTTR]]). It is very important to have a proper understanding of what are mission-essential functions, how to perform an identification of critical systems and be able to explain how a single point of failure can negatively impact the organization. ([[BYOD]], [[MDM]], [[CYOD]])
\
As for risk management processes and concepts, candidates must be able to explain the different types of threat assessments, including the various threat sources (i.e., [[Environmental_Threat]], [[Manmade_Threat]], [[Internal_Threat]] vs. [[External_Threat]]), apply risk assessment techniques such as combining the single-loss expectancy ([[SLE]]) with the annual rate of occurrence ([[ARO]]) and defining the annualized loss expectancy ([[ALE]]), understand how to best define [[Asset_Value]], identify threats and their likelihood of occurrence, calculate its impact ([[BIA]]) and define risk levels both in [[Quantitative_Risk_Levels]] and [[Qualitative_Risk_Levels]] terms. They will also need to know [[Risk_Response_Techniques]] that will define if it can be accepted as is, or if a risk must be transferred, mitigated or completely avoided.
\
As expected, candidates should be able to compare and contrast the various types of [[Security_Controls]] (i.e., deterrent, preventive, detective, corrective, compensating, technical, administrative and physical) and also be able to carry out data security and privacy practices such as [[Secure_Data_Destruction]] and media sanitization, data sensitivity labeling and handling, defining data roles (such as [[Data_Owner]], [[Data_Steward]]/[[Data_Custodian]] and [[Privacy_Officer]]), defining the required level of [[Data_Retention]] and even understanding legal and compliance requirements.
\
Compliance is actually a very important topic in this domain; testers will have to have solid knowledge of the many important regulations that regulate every aspect of their work, including [[PCI_DSS]], [[SOX]], [[HIPAA]], [[GDPR]], [[FISMA]], [[NIST]], [[FERPA]], [[GLBA]], and [[CCPA]].
\
Apart from implementing and maintaining effective security systems, protecting digital assets entails necessarily addressing the risks related to the human element. As security is only as strong as the weakest link, awareness is thought of as a cardinal point in any effective defense strategy. The test, then, covers the importance of involving users from onboarding with directives, proper training (computer-based, role-based ([[RBAC]]), simulations and more) and dissemination of clear Policies ([[AUP]], [[GPO]], [[Policy]]).
