SOC Analyst and Their Responsibilities:
\
a SOC Analyst is the first line of defense when it comes to forensic investigations from attacks done to a system.
\
General Routine:
\
Throughout the day a SOC analyst will generally examine alerts on the SIEM and determine which ones are real threats To reach a conclusion they will utilize various security products such as EDR, Log Management and SOAR. 
\
To be a successful SOC analyst who is not dependent on security products and can correctly analyze SIEM alerts one needs to have the following competencies:
\
- Operating Systems
	- To be able to detect what is abnormal in a system one must primarily know what is accepted as normal. For example, there are multiple services within the Windows operating system and it is hard to detect which of these are suspicious without knowing which are or could be normal Windows services. For this reason, you should know the basic logic of how Windows/Linux operating systems work.
\
- Network
	- First and foremost, we will be handling many malicious IPs and URL addresses, and will have to check if there are any devices on the network trying to connect to these addresses. If we can control this then it will set the tone of our analysis. As a more complicated step we may have to detect a potential data leak on the network. To be able to carry out all these functions we need to know the basics of networking.
\
- Malware analysis
	- There will always be some kind of malware involved when dealing with most threats. In order to be able to understand what the actual purpose of these malwares are (they sometimes display different behaviors to mislead analysts) you need to have some skills in malware analysis. It is important to at least determine what the malicious file's command and control center is and whether or not there is a device communicating with this address.
