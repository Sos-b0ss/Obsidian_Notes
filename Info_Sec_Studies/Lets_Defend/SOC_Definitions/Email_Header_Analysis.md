 **Are the data "From" and "Return-Path / Reply-To" the same?**  
\
Except in exceptional cases, we expect the sender of the e-mail and the person receiving the responses to be the same. An example of why these areas are used differently in Phishing attacks:
\
Someone sends an email (gmail, hotmail etc.) with the same last name of someone working for Google to LetsDefend, LetsDefend tells the employee that he has issued the invoice and they must make the payment to his XXX account. It puts the e-mail address of the real Google employee in the "Reply-to" field so that the fake e-mail address does not stand out in case of replying to a possible e-mail.
