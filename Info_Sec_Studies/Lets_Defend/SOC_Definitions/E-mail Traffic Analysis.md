Many parameters are needed when analyzing a phishing attack. We can learn the size of the attack and the target audience in the search results to be made on the mail gateway according to the following parameters.

-   Sender Address(info@letsdefend.io)
-   SMTP IP Address(127.0.0.1)
-   @letsdefend.io (domain base)
-   letsdefend (Besides the gmail account, attacker may have sent from the hotmail account)
-   Subject (sender address and [[SMTP]] address may be constantly changing)
\
In the search results, it is necessary to learn the recipient addresses and time information besides the mail numbers. If harmful e-mails are constantly forwarded to the same users, their e-mail addresses may have leaked in some way and shared on sites such as PasteBin.

Attackers can find email addresses with [[TheHarvester]] tool on Kali Linux. It is recommended that such information should not be shared explicitly, as keeping personal mail addresses on websites would be a potential attack vector for attackers.
